      The  Toolkit can now  support more than  one Host Adapter on 
      the  same  computer.   This  new  capability  should have no 
      effect on current users of the Toolkit.  The high order four 
      bits of the "scsiaddress" byte  in an oemtable structure are 
      used to identify a specific Host Adapter.  Host Adapters are 
      assigned  a  logical  adapter  number  by the Toolkit on the 
      first call  to the Toolkit.   The numbers range from 0 to 7.
      Four  TMC  style  adapters  can  be supported, and eight MCS 
      style adapters.  The first adapter found is always number 0.
      If this is the only adapter installed,  the Toolkit works as 
      before with the high order bits of a "scsiaddress" set to 0.




      You can  determine how many Host  Adapters are installed, as 
      follows: 

      a. Call  oemscsi with the  Host Adapter field  (high order 4 
         bits) of  "scsiaddress" set to zero.   Test Unit Ready on 
         SCSI address zero is a good request to use.

      b. If  oemscsi  returns  an  "adaptererr"  of  -16,  no Host 
         Adapter  is  installed.   Any  other  status  means  Host 
         Adapter zero is installed.

      c. Increment  the  number  in  the  Host Adapter  field, and 
         repeat the  call.  When a status of  -16 is returned, the 
         previous Host Adapter number is the last adpater.          

      A  new  routine  has  been  added  to  reset a specific Host 
      Adapter.  This  routine is  called with  a "scsiaddress"  as 
      its only argument.  Again  the high order four bits  of this 
      byte identify the Host Adapter.
