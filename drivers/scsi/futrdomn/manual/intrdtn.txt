Future Domain's OEM Developer Tool Kit is designed to provide the writer of
device drivers and utilities with the information needed to effectively
utilize the complete line of SCSI host adapter products produced by Future
Domain. The Tool Kit consists of this manual and a DOS compatible diskette
that contains example routines for both the ROM BIOS interface and the OEM
interface. This code (written in "C" language and assembly language) is 
provided on a license basis, but may be included in your driver with no 
royalty cost to you.

Future Domain's product line currently consists of the following host
adapters:
        TMC-850              TMC-1660
        TMC-860              TMC-1680
        TMC-875              MCS-700
        TMC-885              MCS-350
                     
The following host adapters are old product lines and are not currently sold
through regular channels, but are supported through this version of the
OEM Developers Tool Kit :

        TMC-820              TMC-870
        TMC-830              TMC-880
        TMC-840

Two levels of support are provided. One level is the interface to Future
Domain's proprietary ROM BIOS, and the other is the OEM Interface Routines, a 
general purpose interface direct to Future Domain's SCSI adapter I/O ports.

Although the hardware design of these products is different, they all share a
similar ROM BIOS interface and a common set of OEM Interface Routines. The
ROM BIOS and the OEM Interface routines allow writing code that does not need
to communicate with the SCSI interface directly and is therefore immune to
hardware differences.  All low level I/O is handled by these routines to allow
portability of user code among different Future Domain products, current and
future.
