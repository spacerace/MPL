Code 07                                  -Format Unit, No List

Input registers - AL contains the interleave which is output as byte 
4 of the command.

Special output registers - none.

Operation:

    The SCSI Format Unit (04) command is issued to the device. Byte 1
    contains only the LUN  with no special flags set. Byte 4 is the 
    interactive. After the command is issued, the BIOS waits for the 
    completion by looking for the Status/Message phase of the 
    operation. There is no predetermined length of time to use for a 
    timeout, so if the device hangs, the only method of recovery is 
    to restart the system.
