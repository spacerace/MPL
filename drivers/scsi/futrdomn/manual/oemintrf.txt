O- General Description

These routines allow the user to build their own set of specialized utility 
or driver programs and to communicate directly with specific devices. This 
eliminates worry about the low level hardware interface commands, SCSI bus 
phase issues, hardware timeouts, and differences between host adapters models.
The routines can be executed from either "C" language or assembly language 
programs.

O- Tool Kit Routines

There are two routines available. The two routines are contained in the same 
object file, OEMSCSI.OBJ. They are as follows:

    oemreset ();
    oemscsi (&oemtable);

The first routine, oemreset(), is used to assert and deassert the hard SCSI 
Reset line on the SCSI bus. This function should only be used in a condition 
where there is a timeout on the SCSI bus as indicated in the returned status 
from a call. Using this routine can cause initial error returned status from
your device. Consult your device manual for further information on clearing
out this status. This operation also required a recovery period on the part 
of all devices on the SCSI bus.

The second routine, oemscsi (&oemtable), is the routine used to send commands
to devices over the SCSI bus. It handles the data phase, the status phase, and
the message phase of the request. This interface does not support the 
arbitration reselection features of the host adapters.
