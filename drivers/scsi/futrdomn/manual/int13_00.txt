Input registers - none.

Special output registers - none.

Operation:

    The SCSI Reset line is asserted and deasserted followed by a delay of 
    about 2 seconds. After the delay, each drive that was recognized during 
    the boot operation is issued a Recalibrate command, and if an error is 
    returned, the status is read via a Request Sense Command. This clears out
    any error status that  may have been caused by the reset.

    The status from the request sense command is not returned to the caller 
    as this is done for every disk connected to the adapter.
