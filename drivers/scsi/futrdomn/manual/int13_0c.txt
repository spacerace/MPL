Code OC                                 -Disk Seek

Input registers - As defined under general usage with the exception 
that there is no use of the buffer pointer ES:BX.

Special output registers - none.

Operation:

    The caller's parameters are converted to a logical sector address 
    in the same manner as is done in the Disk Read command. A SCSI 
    Seek command is issued. All SCSI read and writes have implied 
    seeks.

    WARNING:  There are some "performance" tests on the market that 
              use this BIOS call to check for seek times. With SCSI 
              drives, invalid results are obtained because   the 
              parameters returned (See Code 19) are not the actual 
              physical parameters of the drive.
