Code 05                                  -Mode Select

Input registers - ES:BX points to a buffer containing the bytes that are to 
be output during the data phase of the mode select command. Byte 0 contains 
the length of the buffer in bytes to be output. Bytes 1-n are the data bytes.

Special output registers - none.

Operation:

    The purpose of this command is to send the required parameters to the 
    device in preparation for the issuing of the unit format command. The 
    SCSI Mode Select (15h) command is issued to the specified device. The 
    length of the data phase is taken from byte 0 of the caller's buffer.
    During the data phase of the command, successive bytes are taken from the
    caller's buffer and sent to the device.

    A check is made for SCSI Request asserted, and SCSI C/D deasserted between
    each byte. If C/D is asserted or the buffer is exhausted, the operation 
    proceeds to the Status/Message phase.

    If an error is detected during the Status/Message phase, a SCSI Request 
    Sense is issued and the results returned in AH/AL.
