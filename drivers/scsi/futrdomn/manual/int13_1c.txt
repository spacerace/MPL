Code 1C                            Locate Driver Letter Table

Input registers - none.

    
Special output registers - ES:BS points to a character array that could be 
used by utilities or a loadable driver as a table of drive letters. In Host 
adapters using BIOS 1.0-1.2 and 6.0, this table is 26 bytes long and in 
Host adapters using BIOS 4.0 and 5.0-5.2 the table is 6 bytes long.

Operation:

    This table is filled with the assigned DOS disk drive letters when the 
    Future Domain Loadable driver is executed. The table is then used to 
    specify the drive letter for utilities. It is not necessary to use this 
    feature to make the ROM BIOS operational.
