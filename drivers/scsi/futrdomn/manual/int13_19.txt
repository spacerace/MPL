Code 19                                  -Read Drive Capacity

Input registers - none.

Special output registers - Same as for Code 15.

Note:    Future Domain ROM BIOS' write protect removable media drives until 
         this call is made. This is designed to protect data on removable 
         cartridges until a driver that understands removable media makes 
         this call.

Operation:

    A SCSI Read Capacity (25h) command is issued to the specified disk. All 
    of the command bytes are set to zero. The following parameters are then 
    updated in the internal table for the disk. See Code 1Bh for a complete 
    explanation of the internal table.

    Total Capacity - This is a double work parameter. The capacity is returned
    as the number of equivalent 512 byte sectors.

    The number of heads, sectors per track, and cylinders are calculated as 
    follows: The number of sectors per track is fixed at 17 because there are
    some RAM BIOS systems which use that as a fixed assumption and will not 
    work with a different number. The number of cylinders cannot exceed 1024 
    as this is the maximum field size. Therefore, the total capacity is 
    divided by 1024 and the result divided by 17. The result is incremented 
    by one and becomes the number of heads. The new heads value is multiplied
    by 17 and divided into the total capacity again with the result becoming 
    the total number of cylinders to use. Note that these numbers will 
    probably not match the physical characteristics of the disk.
