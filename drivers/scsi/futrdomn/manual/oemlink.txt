The OEM Interface uses a single segment as follows:

_TEXT SEGMENT BYTE PUBLIC 'CODE'

If the user interface is in assembly language the assembly language module 
should have the same code segment name. The small model uses a near pointer
to the data structure and a near return, the medium model uses a far pointer 
to the data structure and a near return, while the large model uses a far 
pointer to the data structure and a far return.

In C, the OEMSCSI, OEMSCSIM, or OEMSCSIL object module must be specified as 
part of the link process. The /Zp option of the Microsoft Compiler should be
used.
