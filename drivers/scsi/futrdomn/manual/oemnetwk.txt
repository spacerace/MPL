      Logic has been added to permit operation of the Toolkit in a 
      network  environment.   On  each  call  to  the Toolkit when 
      operating  in a network environment,  a LockChannels request 
      is made at the beginning of the call, and  a ReleaseChannels 
      call  is  made  at  the   end;  to prevent conflicts between 
      network users and Toolkit users of devices on a SCSI bus.
