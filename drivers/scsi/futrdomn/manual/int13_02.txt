Code 02                                  -Disk Read

Input registers - as defined under general assignment.

Special output registers - none.

Operation:

    Two internal parameters are used to convert the caller's head, sector, and
    cylinder number to a SCSI logical block number. These parameters are the 
    heads per cylinder and sectors per track numbers. The source of these 
    numbers is discussed under Codes 08 and 19. If the drive has 256 byte 
    sectors, the logical block number and the length are multiplied by two 
    before being sent to the drive.

    If the SCSI bus is not in an idle condition at the start of the command 
    execution, an Initialize System (Code 00) is executed and an error return
    made to the caller.

    A SCSI Read command (08) is issued to the specified disk. The BIOS then 
    waits for SCSI Request to be asserted. When it is asserted, a check is 
    made to verify that SCSI C/D is not asserted. If C/D is asserted, 
    operation proceeds directly to the Status/Message phase.

    Data is transferred in blocks of 512 and 256 bytes, depending on the 
    drive's sector size. After the request is detected, a sector sized block
    is transferred to the caller's buffer. If the  transfer is complete,
    the operation proceeds to the Status/Message phase; otherwise, it waits 
    again for the SCSI Request line to be asserted.

    If there is an error reported in the Status/Message phase of the
    operation, the SCSI Request Sense command is issued and the results 
    returned as an error in AH/AL.
