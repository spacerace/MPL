Code 0E                                  -Read Local Buffer

Input registers - ES:BS points to the caller's 512 byte buffer.

Special output registers - none.

Operation (For Host adapters using BIOS 4.0):

    The contents of a local 512 byte buffer are returned to the 
    caller. This is the same data written out by the Write Local 
    Buffer command. The command is one of the diagnostic tests 
    for the adapter.

Operation (for Host adapters using BIOS 1.0-1.2, 5.0-5.2 or 6.0):

    This command is not implemented. There is insufficient RAM on the
    adapter to store the required information.
