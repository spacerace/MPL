Code 08                                  -Return Parameters

Input registers - none.

Special output registers.

    DH - Number of heads-1
    DL - Number of drives in HF_NUM.
    CH - LSB 8 bits of number of cylinders-1.
    CL - Number of sectors per track + 2 MSB of cylinders - 1.

Operation:

    This function returns the parameters that are used to convert the
    caller's disk address specification into a logical sector number
    to be issued to the SCSI device. The formula used by the ROM BIOS 
    is:

    Sector=cyl*(HEADS*SECTS)+head*SECTS+(sect-1)

         SECTOR   -Logical sector number
         HEADS    -Number of heads reported for device
         SECTS    -Sectors per track reported for device
         cyl      -Caller specified cylinder number
         head     -Caller specified head number
         sect     -Caller specified sector number

    Note that these values need have no relationship to the actual 
    values on the physical drive for cylinders, heads, and sectors 
    per track. These are only "funny" numbers used for the Int 13h 
    call.

    These parameters are based on the standard sector size of 512 
    bytes. If, in fact, the drive used 256 byte sectors, the fact is 
    masked from the system.

    Before the caller makes an Int 13h call to read, write, or verify 
    a logical sector, the reverse of the above algorithm needs to be 
    performed on the desired logical sector number for setting up of 
    the registers.
