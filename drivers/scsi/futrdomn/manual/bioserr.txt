o- Error Code Return

The returned error codes are those used by the Int 13h conventions. The 
recommended mapping to DOS error codes is also given.

When an error status is returned to the ROM, it will attempt to perform a 
request sense command to determine the error. The additional sense information 
byte in the returned sense information is then mapped to one of the BIOS codes 
above. If no additional sense information is provided, the sense key field is
mapped to a BIOS error code.
        
The error codes returned from the SCSI disks are not consistent. As a result,
the error codes cannot accurately reflect all drives. If more detailed 
information is required for a specific operation, use the Int 13h code 1Bh to
locate the Sense Bytes for further analysis.

If there is an error on any request, one of the above BIOS error codes is 
returned in AH/AL and the carry flag is set. If there is not error, AH=AL=0 
and the carry flag is cleared.

Later versions use the extended request sense format and return the following bytes in the data 
table:

    Byte Number              Description

         0                   Additional Sense Code
         1                   Reserved
         2                   Sense Key
         3                   Reserved
