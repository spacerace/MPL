Code 18                             Identify ROM

Input registers - none.

Special output registers -

         AX  - 4321h. This code identifies this as a Future Domain ROM BIOS.

         BH  - Number of disks being supported by this ROM BIOS.

         BL  - Index number for this SCSI disk.

         CH  - ROM Firmware version number. This is 4 for Host adapters using BIOS 
              1.0-1.2, 4.0 or 6.0, and 5 for host adapters using BIOS 5.0-5.2.

         CL  - Drive type code. This is 10 for host adapters using BIOS 1.0-1.2, 4.0 or 6.0 
              and 13 for host adapters using BIOS 5.0-5.2.

Operation:

    The purpose of this command is to locate and identify the address codes 
    that are required for use of the SCSI disks. The Int 13 calls for the SCSI 
    drives are addressed to the hard drives, i.e., disk 0 is 80h, disk 1 is 
    81h,...Note that this addressing includes internal IBM disks as well as 
    the SCSI disks. This command identifies what the base address is for SCSI
    disks.

    Assume that there is one internal hard disk and four SCSI disks. 
    Addressing this command to hard disk address 82h would result in BH=4 
    and BL=1. That means that there are 4 SCSI  disks and that this is the 
    second disk, i.e., they are numbered 1, 1,... The base address for the 
    SCSI disks is therefore 82h-1=h1h, or SCSI disk 0 is address 81h, SCSI 
    disk 1 address is  82h,....

    If this command is issued to an IBM disk controller, it will return an 
    error code.
