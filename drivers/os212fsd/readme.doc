Software requirements:

    OS2 1.2  after internal release 12.134 for minimal functionality.
    OS2 1.21 after internal release 121.185 for CDROM required kernel
             fixes.  This will give the most bug-free operation.

Config.sys Parameters :    May be any of the following.

    /k      Instructs the FSD to first search for a secondary volume
    /K      descriptor.  If not found, the volume descriptors are
            then searched for a primary volume descriptor.  This is
            used to read Kanji disks.

    /c:<#>  Tells the FSD how many 64K segments to use for the sector
    /C:<#>  cache.  The default is 2, meaning 64 sectors are cached.
            This value must be between 1 and 65535.  The actual number 
            of cached sectors is this value times 32.

    /m:<#>  Tells the FSD the maximum number of disk sectors to read at
    /M:<#>  a time.  The default is 8 (16K).  The maximum is 31 sectors
            or 25% of the total sector cache, whichever is smaller.

    /quiet  Suppresses any signon messages.
           
    The /c parameter must appear before the /m parameter or the /m
    parameter will be ignored and the default value used.

    Example :   The following instructs the FSD to search for a secondary
                volume descriptor, cache 128 sectors and read a maximum
                of 20 sectors at a time.  In this case the FSD is 
                put in a directory named c:\ifs.

        ifs=c:\ifs\cdfs.ifs /k /c:4 /m:20

                The following can be used to read the primary volume 
                descriptor use the default cache and read-ahead values.

        ifs=c:\ifs\cdfs.ifs

The CDROM FSD swaps out the sector buffers into the swapfile on the 
harddisk.  The value for the /C parameter is constrained by the swapfile
not the physical memory of the machine.


Put the dll, UCDFS.DLL in a directory on your libpath.

    This dll provides compatibility for the utility functions SYS,
    FORMAT, CHKDSK, and RECOVER.  These are basically no-ops for CDROM
    except CHKDSK which returns the size of the CDROM volume.
