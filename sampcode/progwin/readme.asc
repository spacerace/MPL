      Companion Diskettes for "Programming Windows"
      (c) Charles Petzold, 1990
     -----------------------------------------------

     This diskette contains source code and executable
(.EXE) files for all the sample programs described in
"Programming Windows" by Charles Petzold (Microsoft Press,
1990).  The programs are stored in subdirectories
corresponding to the book chapters.

     The easiest way to copy these programs to your fixed
disk is by using the XCOPY command.  First, create a
subdirectory on your fixed disk:

          MD \PROGWIN

Switch to that subdirectory:

          CD \PROGWIN

Put the diskette in drive A and execute:

          XCOPY A:\*.* /S

     If you want to recreate all the .EXE files, you can run
the MAKEALL.BAT batch file.  To do this, you'll need a
properly installed version of the Microsoft Professional
Development System (also known as C 6.0) and the Microsoft
Software Development Kit 3.0.
