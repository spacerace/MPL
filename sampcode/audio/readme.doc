Sample code for MS CD-ROM Extensions audio:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code in this directory is used to play CD AUDIO from the CD-ROM drive
using the CD-ROM Extentions.

The code first determines if the CD-ROM Extensions are operating in the
system. After finding the Extensions, it will retrieve a pointer to the
first device driver.

By making a IOCTL call, the code will read the TOC (Table Of Contents) from
the active drive.  The TOC contains the position of each audio track.

After receiving this information, all that is needed is to make a single
play call for each track of audio.
