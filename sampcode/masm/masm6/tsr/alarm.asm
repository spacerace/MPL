;* ALARM.ASM - A simple memory-resident program that beeps the speaker
;* at a prearranged time.  Can be loaded more than once for multiple
;* alarm settings.  During installation, ALARM establishes a handler
;* for the timer interrupt (interrupt 08).  It then terminates through
;* the Terminate-and-Stay-Resident function (function 31h).  After the
;* alarm sounds, the resident portion of the program retires by setting
;* a flag that prevents further processing in the handler.
;*
;* NOTE: You must assemble this program as a .COM file, either as a PWB
;*       build option or with the ML /AT switch.
