/* BELL.C - Beeps speaker at preset time. Illustrates how to create
 * a TSR in a high-level language using the TSR library of assembly
 * routines. Also shows how to write a time-activated TSR by passing
 * hour and minute arguments to the Install procedure.
 *
 * To install BELL, include argument hhmm = hour:minute for activation.
 * Argument must be in military format (1855 for 6:55 p.m., for example)
 * and must consist of 4 digits. To activate BELL at 8:30 a.m., enter
 *     BELL 0830
 *
 * Some differences exist between BELL.C and the ALARM.ASM program
 * presented in Section 17.3 of the Programmer's Guide. The C version
 * requires more memory and does not allow multiple installations since
 * it calls the multiplex handler to check for prior residency. BELL
 * is deinstallable at any time, however, by entering
 *     BELL /D
 * at the command line. To reset the number of times BELL beeps the
 * speaker, enter
 *     BELL /Cx
 * where x = desired number of beeps.

/* ILLEGAL C FUNCTIONS
 * -------------------
 * Use of certain C library functions in a resident program is either
 * illegal or ill-advised. These functions include:
 *
 *     exec/spawn functions such as execv(), spawnv(), and system()
 *     environment functions such as getenv(), _searchenv(), and putenv()
 *
 *
 * USING THE HEAP IN A RESIDENT PROGRAM
 * ------------------------------------
 * Functions that use heap space require additional caution. The assembly
 * procedure GetResidentSize returns the amount of memory in paragraphs
 * required by the _TEXT and _DATA segments. It allows a C program to
 * discard segments unused during residency -- segments such as INSTALLCODE,
 * INSTALLDATA, and _STACK. It also truncates the memory occupied by the
 * program's heap.
 *
 * Therefore, if your program uses GetResidentSize to determine its memory
 * requirements, the resident portion of the program must not call functions
 * that make use of the heap. These include:
 *
 *     allocate functions such as malloc()
 *     strdup functions
 *     directory functions such as getcwd() and _getdcwd()
 *     miscellaneous functions such as _fullpath() and tempnam()
 *
 * Note that stream I/O functions such as fputs() also allocate heap space
 * unless a static buffer is provided through the function setvbuf().
 *
 * If you wish to make the heap resident, request a stack size large enough
 * to accommodate the installation code and no more. The _STACK segment
 * below the heap is wasted memory during the program's resident phase.
 *
 *
 * FLOATING-POINT CALCULATIONS
 * ---------------------------
 * For floating-point math operations, specify the alternate math package.
 * This prevents your program from setting up interrupt handlers at startup.
 *
 *
 * STACK-CHECKING
 * --------------
 * Turn off stack-checking for resident function(s) as follows:
 */

#pragma check_stack ( off )

/* This is necessary because the Activate procedure in HANDLERS.ASM
 * switches stacks. To adjust the size of the TSR's stack, reset the
 * constant STACK_SIZ in the file TSR.INC and rebuild the program by
 * assembling the HANDLERS.ASM module and relinking.
 */


/* Beeper - Writes ASCII character 07 (bell character) to the
 * screen to beep the speaker. Iterates BeepCount times.
 *
 * Params:  None
 *
 * Return:  None
 */
void far Beeper( void )
{
    int i;
    for( i = 0; i < BeepCount; ++i )

        _asm
        {
