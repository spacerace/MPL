  Companion Disk to "Programming the OS/2 Presentation Manager"
  -------------------------------------------------------------

     This disk contains source code and executable files for 
all programs shown in "Programming the OS/2 Presentation Manager" 
(Microsoft Press, 1989).  The files are organized in directories 
by chapter (CHAP02, CHAP03, and so forth).

     Before you begin working with this disk, make a backup copy 
using the OS/2 DISKCOPY command.  You can copy the disk 
contents to your hard disk by first creating a directory for it:

          MD C:\PMBOOK

and then using the OS/2 XCOPY command:

          XCOPY A:\*.* C:\PMBOOK /S

     The disk includes executable (.EXE) files for all 
programs.  However, to determine if you have the C compiler and 
other programming tools installed correctly, you may want to 
recompile and link the programs yourself.  All programs have a 
MAKE file that performs the compile and link commands.  To 
compile the WELCOME1 program from CHAP02, for example, switch
to the CHAP02 directory and execute

          MAKE WELCOME1 

You can also recompile all programs in a particular directory by 
using this OS/2 command:

          FOR %X IN (*.) DO MAKE %X
