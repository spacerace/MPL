Comments about VECTFONT

This program, written by Charles Petzold, demonstrates OS/2 vector font
capabilities.  In order for the 24 point font demonstration to work, you
must first install the necessary fonts, by using the Control Panel.

This is done as follows:
1.  Bring up the control panel
2.  Select Installation...Add Font
3.  Tell the program the location of the font file (usually C:\OS2\DLL)
4.  Select a font in the font list box, then press the Add button.
5.  At this point, it will ask if you wish that the font be copied
    to the directory C:\OS2\DLL.  Since have just installed the font
    from this directory, this copy step will not be needed -- press "no"
6.  Press the Cancel button to exit the Add Font dialog box
7.  Finally, Exit the control panel

Also, there is an accompanying readme file which describes the program
(this should appear in Microsoft Systems Journal soon)
