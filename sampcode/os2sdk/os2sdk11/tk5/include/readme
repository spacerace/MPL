To place "opendlg.h" in this directory, "cd ..\opendlg" and "make opendlg".
To place "spyhook.h" in this directory, "cd ..\spy" and "make spy(hook)"

selector.h in this directory should remain untouched, as should cmacros.inc.

Cmacros.inc will become obsolete with MASM 6.0 (in fact, many of the macros
can be directly substituted with much faster MASM 5.1 assember directives).
