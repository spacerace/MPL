    The following are the most significant programming differences between
    SDK 1.05 and SDK 1.1.

    1.  Proportional fonts.

        This change involves recompilation, and changing the sizes of
        text fields to accomodate the new text widths.

    2.  FCF flags.

        The flags FCF_SHELLPOSITION, FCF_ICON, FCF_ACCELTABLE, FCF_TASKLIST
        were added to FCF_STANDARD (they used to be FS_ style flags).

        The problems which arise now are that applications that do not
        have either icons or accelerator tables, but use FCF_STANDARD,
        GP fault for no apparent reason.

        Also, if FCF_SHELLPOSITION is not specified, since you have not
        told the system to set the default size/position of your window,
        it does not appear (either it's hidden, or has no size)

    3.  MenuItem syntax changed in resource files.

        The MIS_ and MIA_ flags are now separate in the MENUITEM statement.

            Old:    MENUITEM "X", IDM_X, MIS_TEXT | MIA_DISABLED
            New:    MENUITEM "X", IDM_X, MIS_TEXT, MIA_DISABLED
