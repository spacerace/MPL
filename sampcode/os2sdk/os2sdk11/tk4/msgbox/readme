Comments about MSGBOX

The MSGBOX program brings up a dialog box that allows the user to
experiment with all possible combinations of message box styles.

There are three groups of radio buttons corresponding to the button
configuration, icon displayed, and default button values.  One choice
of each of these determines the look of the message box.  The style
value computed from these choices is displayed in the Message Box
Style edit box.  The return value of the WinMessageBox() routine is
displayed in the Return Code box.  The "Show Box" button is used to 
cause a message box to be displayed.
