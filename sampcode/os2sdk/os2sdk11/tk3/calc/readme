comments about CALC



CALC is a simple calculator, ported from the Windows version.
You can operate the calculator keys by clicking with the
left mouse button.  Keyboard operation is also supported:

    Q = square root
    N = sign change
    M = memory shift key.  For memory operations, hold down the
	'M' key and then one of 'C', 'R', '+', and '-'.

Hit-testing on the calculator keys is done by explicit calculation
in the CALC program.

DCALC achieves the same functionality by using a dialog box, so that
PM does the work of deciding which calculator key was selected.
