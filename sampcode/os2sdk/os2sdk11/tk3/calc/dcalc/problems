
		Problems with the DCalc Sample

 ** When the window is minimized, one of the buttons overlays the window
    icon.

 ** When the window is minimized, a click on the icon does not bring up
    the system menu.  Instead the mouse cursor changes to the calculator
    icon, as if the Move command were selected.

Note:  One solution to both these problems is not to allow the window to
       become minimized.
