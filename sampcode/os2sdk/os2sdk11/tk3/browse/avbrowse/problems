
		Problems with the AVIO Browsing sample

 ** The text background should be white.  This can be done by sending the
    correct Ansi escape sequence through VioWrtTTY.

 ** All the AVio support should be placed in a dyn-link so that its workings
    can be divorced from the way that text is stored and retrieved.  This
    dyn-link should support multiple AVio windows from a single application.
    The window class should be registered by the dynlink on first invocation.
    The probably also means that the creation call should pass the window
    handles for the scroll bars that go with the avio window, since we
    may have several windows and consequently several scroll bar pairs.
