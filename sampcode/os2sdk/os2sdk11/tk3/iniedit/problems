 ** It uses fixed size string variables for all the OS2.ini strings.
    This should be changed to use heap allocation.  The current
    implementation is wasteful of space and fails in bizarre ways
    when it encounters a string longer than its built-in limit.

    One example of such a long string is when the Epson printer driver
    is loaded.

 ** The scroll bars are not tied to the arrow keys.  This is a great
    inconvenience for keyboard-only OS/2 users.
