Comments about DLGSAMP

DLGSAMP is "well-documented" (perhaps to a far extreme).  Running the
program is fairly self-explanatory.

The icon is supposed to be a set of three radio buttons.  Modal/Modeless 
refers to what type of dialog box style you want.

  "A modal dialog is destroyed before control is returned to the
   invoking winproc, so it must pass the contents of its Entry Fields etc.
   back to the invoking window before it returns.

   When a modeless dialog box returns it still continues to exist. It
   could pass the contents of its Entry Fields etc. back to the
   invoking window in several ways."
