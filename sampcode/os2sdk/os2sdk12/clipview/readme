Information about CLIPVIEW

ClipView allows the user to browse the contents of the clipboard.  It
demonstrates several things:  How to process clipboard formats, how to
handle scroll bars (in the BITMAP case), how to use listboxes effectively
(the Render... dialog box), how to save > 64K BITMAP files (as Linefrac
does), how to use metafiles, and how to create and use the multi-line
edit control.

There is a lot of additional functionality which can be added to the
clipboard viewer (see the PROBLEMS file which has been included).

NOTE:	This file requires the OPENDLG.DLL library to be on the LIBPATH
	variable (in CONFIG.SYS).  Otherwise, the program won't run.
