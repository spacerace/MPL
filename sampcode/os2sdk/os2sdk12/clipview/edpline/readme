This program is a prototype for the standard mouse interface of
dragging points around and rubberbanding primitives.


To use:
-------

To add or move points, click on the LEFT mouse button.

  If you click within about 3 pels of an existing point, you can drag it
    around in the usual way.

  If you click within about 3 pels of an existing line, but not near a
    point, you will insert a point between the endpoints of the nearest line
    segment.

  Otherwise, you will append a control point to the list.


To remove points, click on a point with the RIGHT mouse button.

  You can drag the point around, but it will disappear as
  soon as you lift up on the mouse button.


The primitives can be displayed independently, and show up in different
colors so they can be distinguished (especially near endpoints).  Selecting
"None" clears all the selected primitives.

Rubberbanding is done by drawing in xor mode, so for each movement
you will draw the object twice.  When moving, adding, or removing control
points, only the one currently selected will be drawn.

There's a limit of 20 control points.  If you try to add more than that,
a message box appears.	There's a bug that forces you to click twice after
closing down the error message box before you can grab a point for moving
or removing.
