Implemented
-----------
Save clipboard to file
Owner-display support (untested)
Modifications to EDPLINE for writing a metafile to the clipboard
Allows > 64K bitmaps (from Linefrac code)
Allows the user to select which format to render
Scroll bar processing
Should check error return codes, add more comments

Bugs
----
GpiPlayMetafile() occasionally RIPs on the Debug terminal.  This may be
because of an invalid Metafile; but there are no errors returned by Gpi.

Should allow saving of > 64K text selectors, sharing the code which saves
large BITMAPs.

The scroll bars should be redone so that they appear/disappear as needed.

Features that haven't made it (yet)
-----------------------------------
Should pop up a dialog box (depending on format rendered) which
    gives viewing options.  In the metafile case, this would allow
    the user to set the alOptions[] matrix.  In the text case, this
    might allow the user to select a font to view.  In the case of
    an unknown format, this would allow the user to try to view the
    format as Text, Bitmap, or Metafile.
Should disable menu items when they aren't applicable
Should allow saving of owner draw formats and such (just write the bitmap)
Should allow usage of MLE features like string search, font changing
Should use multiple threads
Should have the SB_SLIDERPOSITION message use Scroll & paint invalid region
    instead of invalidating the entire client area.
