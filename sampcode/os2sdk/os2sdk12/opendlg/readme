Comments about OPENDLG


OPENDLG is a dll which is copied to the ..\dll directory.  Programs
which use OPENDLG will need the files OPENDLG.LIB and OPENDLG.H, which
are placed in the ..\lib and ..\include directories, respectively.

OPENDLG contains the code for two dialog boxes, one for opening files
for reading, and the other for opening/creating files for writing (saving).

HELLO is a sample app which illustrates each kind of dialog box.
