Comments about BIO

When you first enter the BIO program, you should enter your birthdate;
then click the "Ok" button.  If you hit <Return> after entering an input
line, it will actually start the program, but probably not with the
parameters you want.  Options can be changed with (Options...Dates)
and recorded in OS2.INI for automatic recall when the program is run
subsequently.

There is also a "Legend" option, which allows you to examine the legend
of the biorhythm chart; and you can use the scrollbar to view biorhythms
for the past and the future.

The program illustrates handling the mouse/keyboard interface, managing
dialog box input, system proportional font handling, use of child windows,
scroll bars, memory bitmaps, copying bitmaps to the clipboard, using the
OS2.INI file, accelerator keys, and subclassing the frame to modify its
behavior.
