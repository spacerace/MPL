Comments about PMCAP

This utility is very useful for snapshotting screen images into bitmaps,
and, more especially, for seeing how a screen will look in black and
white (select the Monochrome option).  Monochrome bitmaps can be saved
to a Windows Paint file; however, this option only works with EGA displays.
Full color shots can be saved as bitmaps.

Limitations:  This utility only snaps full screens.  To snap partial areas,
please refer to the SNAP utility, or to the sample in Chapter 15 of Charles
Petzold's book (BLOWUP), which snaps to the clipboard.
