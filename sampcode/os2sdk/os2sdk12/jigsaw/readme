Comments about JIGSAW

General Description
-------------------

This program demonstrates the use of GPI retained segments by turning
an arbitrary bitmap into a jigsaw puzzle.  The bitmap is divided into
pieces, each piece represented by a single retained segment.  The
user can jumble the pieces, or drag them around the screen.  Dragging
can be accomplished with a piece which contains the appropriate bitmap
fragment, or with a piece drawn in the faster outline mode.
