Comments about CLOCK

The program illustrates various Gpi calls.  It starts a timer
which sends it WM_TIMER messages once per second.  DosGetDateTime
returns the system time.  The various graphical parts of the clock
face (face, hour hand, minute hand, second hand, major ticks, minor
ticks), are each drawn by setting the model transform and then
drawing the part in an unchanging location in world space.  Once per
minute, the clock is drawn from scratch.  The second hand is drawn
in XOR mode, so it can be redrawn in its old location (effectively
erasing it) and then drawn in its new location, without requiring
that the whole clock be redrawn.

Under "Preferences", if you select "Hide Frame Controls", all windows
but the client window and the size border disappear.  You can
restore them by double-clicking on the clock window, or by typing
any keyboard character when the clock window has the focus.
