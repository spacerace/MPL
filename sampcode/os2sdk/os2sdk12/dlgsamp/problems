
		Problems with the DlgSamp Sample

 ** The dialog layout should be adjusted to match that of Excel.

 ** Can't we do better?

     -- Pop-up Menus like those on the Mac would be nice.
	That would make for a much more compact dialog.

     -- How about adding some common actions (Rename, Mode, Search, ...)

 ** How about a dynamic hierarchical menu for walking the directory
    tree?
