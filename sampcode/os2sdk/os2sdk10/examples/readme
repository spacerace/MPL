  This is a collection of small routines that demonstrate some of the
  capabilities of the OS  2 operating system.  Many routines are "bound"
  to demonstrate compatability between DOS 3.X and OS/2.

  Below is a list of the programs available under this directory and 
  whether they run both Real and Protected mode.
