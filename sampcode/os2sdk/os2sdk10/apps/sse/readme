SSE is a simple screen editor for OS/2. It shows how to use
the VIO and KBD functions, and also segmented memory management.
The command set and user interface is a subset of that available
in Microsoft QuickBasic. It supports 43 line mode on an EGA. It
will preserve the line mode at startup, unless /43 or /25 is used
to override the default.

Usage:	SSE [/bw] [/43|/25] filename
