This disk contains the Mandelbrot demonstration program for OS/2 graphics.
Features of OS/2 that are demonstrated are:
        Use of 80287
        Creating and using ring 2 IOPL segments
        Ram semaphore usage
        Thread creation and destruction
        EGA screen save and restore (both text and graphics)

The files on this disk are listed below. Note only some of the CNT
files are included on the sample disk due to space limits. You can
generate the rest yourself.

        readme.doc      This file

        cmacros.inc     Include file defining C and assembler interface

        mandel.c        C routine to compute Mandelbrot set
        manditer.asm    Assembler routine containing 80287 routine
        mandel.rsp      Linker response file for linking mandel.exe
        mandel.exe      Executable for above

        mdraw.c         C routine to display Mandelbrot set
        mdraw.h         Include file for display program
        setscan.asm     Assembler routines for ring 2 EGA manipulation
        ega.inc         Include file to define EGA registers

        mstat.rsp       Linker response file for linking mstat.exe
        mstat.exe       Executable for above

        zoom00.cnt      Count file for entire Mandelbrot set
        zoom01.cnt      Count file for a small area near the Mandelbrot set
        cd14.cnt        Count file for a small area near the Mandelbrot set

For further information about the programs and how to use them, please read
the program headers in:
        mandel.c
        mdraw.c
        mstat.c

Note that for a worst case (all screen points within the Mandelbrot set), the
computation will require approximately 20 hours on an 8 mhz AT with a normal
80287.  The program mandel is 80287 limited so that only faster 80287 chips
will significantly speed up the computation.

To display the included sets:
        Boot MS OS/2
        Start up a screen group
        enter   mdraw zoom00
        Switch to the session manager
        Start another screen group
        enter  mdraw zoom01

You can now hot key switch between the two displays.

MS C 5.0 compiler and runtime libraries and the MS assembler 4.00 are required
to build these programs.
