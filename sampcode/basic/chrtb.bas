'*** CHRTB.BAS - Chart Routines for the Presentation Graphics Toolbox in
'           Microsoft BASIC 7.0, Professional Development System
'              Copyright (C) 1987-1989, Microsoft Corporation
'
'  NOTE:  This sample source code toolbox is intended to demonstrate some
'  of the extended capabilities of Microsoft BASIC 7.0 Professional Development
'  system that can help to leverage the professional developer's time more
'  effectively.  While you are free to use, modify, or distribute the routines
'  in this module in any way you find useful, it should be noted that these are
'  examples only and should not be relied upon as a fully-tested "add-on"
'  library.
'
'  PURPOSE: This file contains the BASIC source code for the Presentation
'           Graphics Toolbox Chart Routines.
'
'  To create a library and QuickLib containing the charting routines found
'  in this file, follow these steps:
'       BC /X/FS chrtb.bas
'       LIB chrtb.lib + chrtb + chrtasm + qbx.lib;
'       LINK /Q chrtb.lib, chrtb.qlb,,qbxqlb.lib;
'  If you are going to use this CHRTB.QLB QuickLib in conjunction with
'  the font source code (FONTB.BAS) or the UI toobox source code
'  (GENERAL.BAS, WINDOW.BAS, MENU.BAS and MOUSE.BAS), you need to
'  include the assembly code routines referenced in these files.  For the
'  font routines, create CHRTB.LIB as follows before you create the
'  QuickLib:
'       LIB chrtb.lib + chrtb + chrtasm + fontasm + qbx.lib;
'  For the UI toolbox routines, create the library as follows:
'       LIB chrtb.lib + chrtb + chrtasm + uiasm + qbx.lib;

'
'  Return Values:
'     Returns the specified pattern in specified color.
'
'  Remarks:
'     In screen modes where a pixel on the screen is represented by 1 or
'     more bits that are adjacent in memory, a byte of memory represents
'     one or more pixels depending on the number of bits per pixel the
'     mode uses (e.g. screen mode 1 uses 2 bits per pixel so each byte
'     contains 4 pixels).  To make a pattern tile in a specific color
'     you first decide which pixels should be on and which ones off.
'     Then, you set the corresponding two-bit pixels in the tile bytes
'     to the value of the color you want the pattern to be.  This routine
'     does this semi-automatically.  First it inputs a reference pattern that
'     contains the pattern defined in the highest color available for a
'     screen mode (all bits in a pixel set to one).  Then a color mask byte
'     is prepared with each pixel set to the color that was specified as
'     input to the routine.  When these two components (reference pattern
'     and color mask) are combined using a logical "AND" any pixel in the
'     reference pattern that was black (all zero) will remain black and any
'     pixel that was white will be of the input color.  The nice feature of
'     this scheme is that you can use one pattern set for any color
'     available for the screen mode.
'
'     Example: Screen mode 1; 2 bits per pixel; to build a pattern
'              with pixels alternating on and off in color 2:
'
'     Reference pattern:   11 00 11 00    (8 bits = 1 byte)
'     Color mask:          10 10 10 10    (each pixel set to color 2)
'                         -------------

'=== clBuildPlaneP$ - Builds a pattern tile for multiple bit-plane screen modes
'
'  Arguments:
'     Bits%    =  Number of planes in this screen mode

'
'     InP$     =  Reference pattern

'  Return Values:
'     Returns the specified pattern in specified color
'
'  Remarks:
'     PAINT tiles are different for screen modes that use 2 or more
'     bit-planes than for the modes that use only one (see remarks for
'     clBuildBitP$()).  When bit-planes are used each pixel requires only
'     one bit per byte, but, there needs to be one byte for each bit-
'     plane.  The process for building a pattern from a reference pattern
'     and color mask are logically the same as in the one bit-plane modes
'     the only difference is that a color mask requires several bytes
'     (one for each bit-plane) rather than one.
'
'  Example: Screen mode 9 with 2 bit planes; pattern with alternating
'           pixels on and off; color 2:
'
'           Reference pattern:   1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
