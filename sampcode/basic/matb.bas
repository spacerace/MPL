'*** MATB.BAS - Matrix Math Routines for the Matrix Math Toolbox in
'           Microsoft BASIC 7.0, Professional Development System
'              Copyright (C) 1987-1989, Microsoft Corporation
'
'  NOTE:  This sample source code toolbox is intended to demonstrate some
'  of the extended capabilities of Microsoft BASIC 7.0 Professional Development
'  system that can help to leverage the professional developer's time more
'  effectively.  While you are free to use, modify, or distribute the routines
'  in this module in any way you find useful, it should be noted that these are
'  examples only and should not be relied upon as a fully-tested "add-on"
'  library.
'
'  Purpose:
'This toolbox contains routines which perform elementary operations on systems
'of linear equations represented as matrices.  The functions return integer
'error codes in the name and results in the parameter list.  The functions
'matbs?% and matlu?% found in this module are intended for internal use only.
'Error codes returned:
'     0  no error                     -1  matrix not invertible
'    -2  matrix not square            -3  inner dimensions different
'    -4  matrix dimensions different  -5  result matrix dimensioned incorrectly
'    any other codes returned are standard BASIC errors
'
'-------------------------------------------------------------------
'MatDet, MatSEqn, and MatInv all use LU-decomposition to implement Gaussian
'elimination.  A brief explanation of what is meant by an LU matrix is given
'below, followed by simplified versions of the two internal routines used to
'do all elimination.
'
'What is meant by an LU matrix:
'An upper triangle matrix (one with all nonzero entries on or above the main
'diagonal) can be solved immediately.  The goal of Gaussian elimination is to
'transform a non upper triangle system into an equivalent triangular one.
'
'Given a system of equations represented in matrix form by Ax=b, we need a
'linear transformation L such that LA=U where U is and upper triangular matrix.
'Then Ux=LAx=Lb and Ux=Lb is an upper triangular system.
'
'This library explicitly calculates U, but L is never saved in its own array.
'When we do a row operation to create a zero below the main diagonal, we no
'longer need to save that value because we know it is zero.  This leaves the
'space available to save the multiplier used in the row operation.  When
'elimination is completed (ie, when the matrix is upper triangular), these
'multipliers give us a complete record of what we did to A to make it upper
'triangular.  This is equivalent to saying the multipliers represent L.  We now
'have a U and an L stored in the same matrix!  This type of matrix will be
'referred to as an LU matrix, or just LU.
'
'The following code fragments get LU and backsolve Ux=Lb.  The actual routines
'used in the toolbox are much more involved because they implement total
'pivoting and implicit row scaling to reduce round off errors.  However, all the
'extras (pivoting, scaling, error checking) are extraneous to the main routines,
'which total only 20 lines.  If you are unfamilar with this type of matrix math,
'gaining an understanding of these 20 lines is a very good introduction.  Try
'working through a 2x2 or 3x3 example by hand to see what is happening.  The
'numerical techniques used to reduce round off error will not be discussed.
'
'-------------------------------------------------------------------
'Given the coefficient matrix A(1 TO N, 1 TO N) and the vector b(1 TO N),
'the following fragments will find x(1 TO N) satisfying Ax=b using Gaussian
'elimination.
'
'matlu:
'Perform row operations to get all zeroes below the main diagonal.
'Define Rj(1 TO N) to be the vector corresponding to the jth row of A.
'Let Rrow = Rrow + m*Rpvt where m = -Rrow(pvt)/Rpvt(pvt).
'Then A(row, pvt)=0.
'

'**    FOR row = (pvt + 1) TO N
