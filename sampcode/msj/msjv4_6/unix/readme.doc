
To install the terminal device driver enter the following line
in your CONFIG.SYS file for MS-DOS 3.1 and above.  The device driver
files are in the \SN0000 (0000 is your serial number) directory.

The STTY.EXE program, found in the \BIN directory, allows you to change 
the device characteristics from the MS-DOS command line.

There are currently four sub-directories for Microsoft \C\MSC, and \BASIC
Each of these have  examples that shows how to interface to 
the terminal file device driver MSJTTY01.SYS whose terminal (file)
file name is "tty01"  The device driver name file name "tty02" 
(for COM2 hardware) is not provided in this demo.

The \C\MSC directory has several demonstration programs that show
different techniques for setting up modes and using the terminal
driver.  Each of the demonstration directories have their 
own README files.

The \BASIC directory provides a simple, however thoroughly documented
example on how to interface to the device driver using the Microsoft 
Quick Basic 6.0 compiler and libraries.  See the file IODEMO.BAS for
the example.   Use the Microsoft MAKE utility to generate the demo
program by issuing the command "MAKE MAKEDEMO" from that directory.
Naturally, the LIB environment variable should contain path(s) to your
basic libraries.

If your a Pascal or Clipper programmer, and can read some C code, 
these examples are well worth your while.  There are directories
for Quick Pascal 1.0 and Turbo Pascal 5.0. and Clipper for the 
non-restricted version.

Before you proceed too far, look at the documentation for the STTY
command.  It is an equivalent of the MODE command under DOS, but
is much more powerful in what it can do.  STTY.EXE in in the \BIN
directory.
