 Checkers -- Part 4 (Microsoft Systems Journal, 9/90)
------------------------------------------------------

The "Advanced" level is currently not working very
well.  It requires an inordinately long time to
determine a best move and often causes protection
exceptions.

Availablility of a less buggy version of the code
will be announced in a future issue of Microsoft
Systems Journal.
