     WNKTERM is a Windows terminal program derived from WNTERM by
adding the Kermit file transfer protocol.  WNKTERM is primarily
an educational example which shows how to program Kermit in the
Microsoft Windows environment and what steps are needed to attach
the resulting Kermit modules to an existing communications
program. 

     The communications features of WNKTERM are identical to the
WNTERM program.  For more information, see WNTERM.DOC. For Kermit
operation, see the file WNKERM.DOC.
