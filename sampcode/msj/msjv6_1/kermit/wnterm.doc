			  Introduction

     WNTERM is a dumb terminal program written for Microsoft
Windows.  The purpose of the program is educational and it is
distributed with source code.  No attempt has been made to add
features such as memory paging, clipboard data exchange, or smart
terminal emulation.  The primary goal is to show how to use the
Windows communications features and to illustrate subclassing and
font enumeration.  Despite its limitations, the program functions
quite adequately as a means for basic communication with another
computer through the serial port.

     WNTERM has a useful option allowing you to choose a font
which will provide the maximum number of visible lines on the
screen.  One possible application is to use WNTERM as a debugging
terminal.  See the sections below on selecting a small font and
the caveats about maximum baud rates.


			Program Operation

     To use the program, copy WNTERM.EXE to an appropriate
directory and run it under Windows.  The program  first tries to
open COM1.  If not successful, it tries successively COM2, COM3,
and COM4.  If this fails, the program exits.  if a port can be
opened, the baud rate, parity, and word size will be set
according to the COMx: strings in the [ports] section of win.ini. 
You should modify these values (use the Control Panel) if to do
so does not interfere with a serial printer setting.  Otherwise,
you can set the desired parameters with the program's
'Communications' menu after startup.

     Before trying to use COM3 or COM4, you must set up the port
addresses used by your hardware.  The entry for COM3 is at 40:6;
COM4 is located at 40:8.  Use DEBUG and the examine command to
enter the values.  Remember that the addresses must be entered in
Intel format (low-order byte first).  Look at the values for COM1
and COM2 found at 40:0 and 40:2 for guidance.  Also, you should
update the equipment word at 40:10, bits 11-9, to show the number
of communications ports your machine has.

     WNTERM, when run in Real or Standard mode Windows, will most
likely operate correctly on COM3 or COM4 after you have made the
entries suggested above in the BIOS data area.  On an ISA bus 386
machine, expect complete failure.  You may be successful on an
EISA bus or Microchannel computer.  At this time there seems to
be lots of problems with how Enhanced mode Windows handles COM3
and COM4.  The general rule is: stay with COM1 and COM2.

     When the window appears, the program will be ready to
communicate with the port shown in the title bar.  You can switch
between line and local operations by toggling the 'Line/Local'
menu item.  At any time, you can clear the screen with the
'ClearScreen' menu choice.  If needed, Local Echo can be
selected.  Scrolling can be started and stopped with the Scroll
Lock key.  Finally, a dialog box is provided to allow you to
vary the communications parameters.


		       Using a Small Font

     After the program has run for the first time, an entry is
made in win.ini of the form:

	[Wnterm]
	SmallFont=0

If you change 0 to 1, the program will search all Courier fonts
installed on your system for the one with the smallest height. 
If one is found with a height less than and of width less than or
equal to that of the Windows system font, then the smaller font
will be used.  In this way, it is possible to have more lines on
the screen.  If you install COURA.FON (which is normally copied
to your Windows directory only if you have a CGA, so you may have
to retrieve it from the distribution disks), you can have as many
as 73 lines on a VGA screen and 53 on the EGA.  If no small font
is found, then the system font will be used.  You will then have
a maximum of 29 lines on the VGA and 32 on the EGA.  (The EGA
system font is only 10 pixels high, whereas on the VGA it is 15).


		   Flow Control and Baud Rates

     The program needs XON-XOFF on the host side for baud rates
above 2400.  At 2400 baud or below, the performance on a 16 mHz.
386 machine is adequate for sustained operation without
handshaking at full screen.  You may have to experiment with
machines of lower performance to find the maximum usable baud
rate with no flow control.  Generally this is of no concern
unless the host is incapable of XON-XOFF as might be the case
when WNTERM is being used as a debugging terminal.


			   Source Code

     The source code is enclosed on the disk.  If you know
Windows programming, it should not be too difficult to read.
