This file describes the sample program included with the Microsoft C Optimizing
Compiler, Version 5.10.


    DEMO.C     Displays program arguments and environment in real, protected,
	       or bound mode. This file is used in the practice session in
	       Chapter 2 of the Microsoft C Optimizing Compiler User's Guide.
    
    CFLOW.C    Displays relationships between the functions of a C  program
	       in real, protected, or bound mode. The file CFLOW.DOC describes
	       how to use this utility.

    SIEVE.C    Finds prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes 
	       algorithm in real, protected, or bound mode.

    GRDEMO.C   Illustrates functions of the graphics library in real
               mode only. 

    SORTDEMO.C Visually illustrates six different sorting algorithms in
	       protected or bound mode. The source code demonstrates how to
	       make OS/2 calls.

    SNAP.C     Runs in the background and saves the current screen in
	       a file when a hot key is pressed. This program runs only
	       in protected mode.

    MHELLO.C   Illustrates multiple threads. This program requires the
	       multiple-thread library. It runs only in protected mode.

    MTMAIN.C   Illustrates dynamic-link libraries. Both multiple-thread
    MTDLL.C    (MT) and single-thread (ST) versions are provided. The 
    STMAIN.C   .DLL modules are dynamic-link libraries. The MAIN modules
    STDLL.C    are programs that call the dynamic-link libraries. This
	       program runs only in protected mode.
