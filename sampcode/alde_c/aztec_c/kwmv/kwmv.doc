This is the source of some tools I developed using the Aztec C system
on the IBM-PC.  You will need the Aztec compiler to compile them as is,
but they can probably be modified to suit another compiler.

The programs mv.com and rm.com both use a different version of the
'pre-main' startup routine Croot than the one in the standard library.
The new Croot expands all ambiguous file names into all matching file names.
so a program like

main(argc,argv)
	char *argv[];
{
	while (--argc)
		puts(*(++argv));
}

will behave like this:

echo *.*
foo
bar
joe

rather than:
echo *.*
*.*

Clever, No?
