CSOURCE V1.0
------------

     Thanks for using CSOURCE.  I'm sure it will prove as useful to you
as it does for me.  CSOURCE requires very little printed documentation.  
Most of the help you will need can be obtained through CSOURCE itself.  The
following is a brief summary of how to start CSOURCE and a few other pieces
of information that you may find useful.


GETTING STARTED
---------------

     To get started, type CSOURCE at the DOS prompt.  You will be presented
with an input screen.  Pressing F2 displays a help screen (after first
displaying an introduction screen) showing the various ways possible to
enter source files.  There are basically three ways to enter files:

     1.  C>  CSOURCE
         --- No command line parameters.  When CSOURCE sees that there are
             no command line parameters, you are taken directly to the
             input screen where source files are entered manually.

     2.  C>  CSOURCE FILES.LST
         --- A file name is passed as a command line parameter.  Since there
             are no wildcard characters in the file name, CSOURCE assumes
             that all the files you wish entered are contained in file
             FILES.LST.  Note that this file name could have contained a full
             drive and path name.  For example, "c:\directory\files.lst"
             would have been perfectly ok.

     3.  C>  CSOURCE *.c
         --- The command line parameter contains wildcard characters.  CSOURCE
             will therefore include all files with a ".c" extension.  A drive 
             and path name could be included.  For example,  "c:\directory\*.c"
             will include all ".c" files in the "directory" directory.


INPUT SCREEN
------------

     Only the first method listed above takes you to the input screen.  The
other two causes the input screen to be bypassed.  Once here, entering files
is simple.  If a file name is entered without a drive letter or path name,
the current working directory is searched.  Otherwise, the path name is
searched.
     Wildcard characters are permitted.  Entering "*.c" causes the current
working directory to be searched for all ".c" files.  Entering "c:\*.c"
causes the root directory to be searched for all ".c" files.  When entering
wildcard characters, after the search for files is completed, a message will
be displayed telling you how many files were found.
     If a file cannot be found or a subdirectory does not exist, a message 
will pop up informing you of a problem.  Once the message disappears, you
are free to make any changes you wish to the file name.  You can edit the
line of input using the arrow keys and backspace and delete keys.
     You should also notice a status line on the bottom of the screen giving
more directions.
     The limit on the number of source files that can be entered is 500.




MAIN MENU
---------

     After the input screen is completed or if you chose to enter files by
one of the last two methods listed above, you are taken to the main menu
screen.  All the help you will need can be obtained by positioning the cursor
over a particular field of input and pressing the F1 key.  CSOURCE keeps 
track of where you are in the menu and will display the appropiate help
message.
     One area that may not be clear is extractions.  CSOURCE lets you extract
portions of you code to the screen, printer or a file of your choice.
After you press the F10 key to tell CSOURCE that you are done, you will be
given the chance to extract portions of your source code (assuming you
selected the extract option).  It will look as follows:

     Source File:  c:\directory\filename.ext

     Extraction #1:  

You are allowed 10 extractions.  Enter extractions as follows (where the
numbers are line numbers):

     Extraction #1:  45:90    (or)  45-90
     Extraction #2:  121:209  (or)  121-209
     Extraction #3:  300:415  (or)  300-415
     Extraction #4:  (Press <return> to tell CSOURCE you're done)

If you entered more than one source file, you will be given the chance to
extract code from each file.


ERROR CHECKING
--------------

     CSOURCE does some error checking on your source code.  It will tell
you if you have mismatched braces, mismatched single or double quotation
marks and mismatched comment symbols.  Since most compilers do not allow
nested comments, CSOURCE will not allow it either.  If you have mismatched
braces, CSOURCE will display a message telling you so but will keep going.  
Any other error causes CSOURCE to stop and tell you the problem and the line
number(s) of occurrence.  You will then be taken back to the DOS prompt to
correct the error and to try again.


SOURCE CODE AVAILABLE
---------------------

     If you are a first time user, please press F2 at the input screen.  The
shareware nature of this program will be explained as well as how to get a
copy of the source code.  If you have any further questions, you can contact
me at the address listed or through Compuserve.  Thanks again for using
CSOURCE.


FOR YOUR INFORMATION
--------------------

     CSOURCE was written entirely in C and contains approximately 3,500 lines
of code.  The version you are currently using was compiled under Aztec C.
I am in the process of converting to Turbo C.
