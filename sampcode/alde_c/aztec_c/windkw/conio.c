* This module defines the various console I/O functions.  They may
* be called directly, using the names included here, or the header
* file CONIO.H may be included so that more standard names may be
* used.  This source module is provided so that users may customize
* the console I/O functions, if desired.  Note that "cprintf" and
* "cscanf" (included in MC.LIB) call the functions "putch", "getch",
* and "ungetch".

*
* description   This function obtains a string directly from the
*               user's console.  This version uses the buffered
*               keyboard input function supported by the BDOS, so
*               that all of the line editing capabilities are available.
*               The first byte of "s" must be initialized to contain
*               the number of bytes, minus two, in "s".  The string
*               pointer returned is "s+2", which contains the first
*               byte of input data.  Note that "s[1]" will contain
*               the number of characters in the string.  The carriage
*               return (which the user at the console must type to
*               terminate the operation) is replaced by a null byte.
*
* returns       p = pointer to string received

*

*
* synopsis      cputs(s);
*               char *s;        character string to be sent
*
* description   This function sends the specified string directly to
*               the user's console.  The BDOS function for "print
*               string" is used.  The function locates the terminating
*               null byte, changes it to a '$' (the terminator
*               required by the BDOS function), and then changes it
*               back to the null byte before returning.  Thus, the
*               string to be printed cannot itself contain a '$' and
*               it cannot reside in read-only memory (ROM).
*
*               Note that a carriage return or linefeed is NOT appended
*               by this function; they must be included in the string,
*               if desired.
