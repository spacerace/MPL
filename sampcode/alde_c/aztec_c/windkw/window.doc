  WINDOW.C -
Window.c ia a simple window management library based in part on the 
article "A Simple Window Package" by Edward Mitchell in the January
1984 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal.  Ray L. McVay of Arlington, TX 
on 30 August, 1984, entered and made some modifications to the original
code.  The window module was largly rewritten and again made available.
The code may be freely copied at ones own risk and the code can not
be claimed or in any other manner restricted from public access.
This implementation uses dynamically allocated buffers for window 
control blocks and screen save buffers instead of the fixed arrays 
used by Mitchell. This library is written to be  used with the 
Lattice C compiler.  This module was largly rewritten and includes 
a number of new functions.

  VLIB.A -
  An assembly  language  support  library  called  VLIB  is  used  to
interface the  Lattice C  compiler  with  the  IBM  ROM  BIOS  video
routines.  VLIB will undoubtedly have to be rewritten if the window
package  is   to  be  used  with  other  compilers.  The  following
paragraphs should  be of  help to  those folks  who must tread this
path.
  The calling  convention for  Lattice is to push parameters rightmost
first then do an intrasegment call to the function. In other words,
functions are NEAR procedures. Some compilers do intersegment (FAR)
calls to assembly language functions so their parameters will be two
bytes farther away on the stack.
  Functions return  char's and  int's in  the AX register.

  WNDEMO.C -
  Just what it says. WNDEMO shows how to open windows, write strings
in them and close 'em and use some of the other functions.

  FINALLY -
  Since all  the windowing  functions go  through the  standard  BIOS
calls, any display mode can be accommodated. The graphic modes will
require more  attention from  the host  program than  was  paid  in
WNDEMO, but  that (as is so often said) is left as an excercise for
the reader (programmer).
