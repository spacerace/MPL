                             TCXREF V1.0


TCXREF is a Turbo-C listing / cross reference utility .

Usage: TCXREF <filename> <flag(s)>

Flags: -L or /L             = Generate listing only
       -C or /C             = Compressed print option
       -R or /R             = Cross-reference reserved words
       -F or /F <filename>  = Write output to named file

Flags can be mixed and in either case.

Since this is a first try at a xref utility there are a few short commings

1) It will not handle include files :
      This will change if there is enough interest for an upgrade

2) It only handles EpsonMX printer controls for compressed mode :
      A way around this to send the output file to a file and add
      your own controls to the file header and trailer.
      In noncompressed mode the only characters used are formfeed ^L
      and carriage return.

3) In noncompressed mode output defaults to the screen :
      this can be over come by the command
           TCXREF <filename> -f prn
      The listing will now be sent to the printer.

These are the major faults that I am working on.

Now, this is what it can do :

1) It can generate a listing and/or a cross reference of your program

2) It defaults to not xrefing turbo reserved words, but this can be overridden.
      By reserved words I mean the list on page 199 of the users guide.

3) It will send your output to the screen, printer, or file

4) It does not reformat your code and it assumes the code is correctly written
      ie. curly braces are correct.

5) It will correctly handle immbedded comments

6) It can handle up to 1000 seperate variables

I would like to thank Philip Hisley , Dorn Stickler, and Tim Tegtmeier for
Ideas, Directly or Indirectly, that brought about this Utility.


Now for the usual:

 This Executable is shareware so pass it on if you think it's useful.
 If you have used it and think it is a good addition to your library then
 send cash $20 or whatever. This will not only help me but it will provide
 an incentive to update and improve on it thereby indirectly helping you.

 If you have remarks, enhancements or bugs tell me.
 Also *CODE* is appreciated and I will try to give credit where it is due.

 If the response is good enough I will provide updates.

Thank you
