Version 3.3:
            New features.
                Full pull-down menu capability for windows.
                "Smart" text line drawing for windows.
                Ability to give windows a title.

            New functions.
                lprintsb    - prints a bold-faced string on the printer.
                waitkeyt    - halts execution until a key is pressed or until a
                              specified amount of time has elapsed.
                wcclear     - clears window with specified attribute.
                whline      - draws a horizontal text line in active window.
                wtitle      - gives active window a title.
                wvline      - draws a vertical text line in active window.

            Modified functions.
                cvaltype    - tabs and linefeeds were being allowed for alpha
                              types.  Fixed.
                filld       - optimized for performance
                wchgattr    - optimized for performance
                wclear      - is now a macro defined in TCXLWIN.H
                werrmsg     - added new error messages.
                winpread    - optimized for size and performance.  No longer
                              wraps back around when in column 1 of 1st field
                wmbardef    - optimized for size and performance.
                wmbarget    - new parameters taginit and pulldown.  The taginit
                              parameter specifies initial position of the
                              selection bar and the pulldown parameter allows
                              the DownArrow key to act like the Enter key for
                              pull-down menus.  Fixed a bug which caused the
                              editing keys to not work right on some occasions.
                wopen       - now checks for valid box type.
                wrestore    - optimized for performance

                wgetc    - now returns a 0 if error
                wgetchf  - now returns a 0 if error


                                      5    
                wgets    - now returns a return code (see TCXL.H)
                wgetsf   - added an additional possible error code (see TCXL.H)
                wgotoxy  - added an additional possible error code (see TCXL.H)
                wmove    - added an additional possible error code (see TCXL.H)
                wprintc  - added an additional possible error code (see TCXL.H)
                wprints  - added an additional possible error code (see TCXL.H)
                wputc    - now returns a return code (see TCXL.H)
                wputs    - now returns a return code (see TCXL.H)
                wputsf   - now returns a return code (see TCXL.H)

                wtextattr - now returns a return code (see TCXL.H)

            The following functions were changed to recognize the '\r', '\7',
            and the '\t' control characters.
                wputc
                wputs
                wputsf

            wprints() was changed so it will not recognize the '\n' control
            character and it will no longer scroll the window when at the end
            of it.  For these purposes, use the wputs() function instead.

            ssave() and srestore() were converted to assembly language for
            optimized performance.


Version 2.1:
            Added new functions.  See TCXL.DOC for full descriptions and
            examples.

            Expanded the window record structure (_wrecord) to include more
            information useful for window management.  See TCXL.H for the
            layout of the _wrecord structure.

            Modifed some of the existing functions.
                getchf  - optimized for better performance
                wactiv  - modified to work with new window record

                wputc   - modified to work with new window record, now returns
                          type void, fixed a bug which caused it not to work
                          sometimes
                wputs   - changed return type to void and optimized for better
                          performance, also now recognized the backspace '\b'
                          character
                wscroll - modified to work with new window record


Version 2.0:
            Added a new window task manager which simpilfies use of windowing.
            Several of the windowing functions' syntax have been changed and
            some have been added.  See TCXL.DOC for full descriptions and
            examples.
                wopen     - now returns a window handle instead of a pointer
                wclose    - closes the currently active window
                wactiv    - new function, activates a currently open window
                            using the window handle returned by wopen()
                wclear    - clears the currently active window
                wgotoxy   - plots cursor coordinates in currently active window
                wmove     - moves currently active window to a new location
                wprintc   - prints a character in the active window, now
                            returns a 1 if cursor placement error occurred
                wprints   - prints a string in the active window, now returns a
                            1 if cursor placement error occurred, now provides
                            wrap-around and scrolling, now also will recognize
                            line feed ('\n') characters in string
                wputc     - prints a character in currently active window at
                            current cursor location, uses attribute set by the
                            wtextattr() function
                wputs     - prints a string in currently active window at the
                            current cursor location, uses attribute set by the
                            wtextattr() function
                wscroll   - scrolls text in the currently active window
                wtextattr - sets the default text attribute for several of the
                            windowing functions

            Deleted the wswap() and wswapx() functions as wactiv() takes their
            place.

            Added global variables to assist in managing the windows.
                _wrecord   - an array of structures that contain window handles
                             and window buffer pointers.  See TCXL.H
                _wcurrent  - contains the array subscript of the window that is
                             currently active

                biosver  - now returns pointer to static string instead of
                           allocated string, so DON'T use free() on the
                           string.  Also now independent of Turbo C library.
                box      - fixed a bug that caused this function to misbehave
                           when using the small memory model

                waitkey  - now returns the key pressed

            Borland recently released Turbo C Version 1.5.  Included in their
            standard library now are the functions clreol(), delay(), gotoxy(),
            and sound().  These functions are similar but not identical to
            the TCXL functions of the same name.  To provide compatibility
            with the new Turbo C 1.5 library, I have renamed the affected TCXL
            functions.
                clreol  ->  clreol_
                delay   ->  delay_
                gotoxy  ->  gotoxy_
                sound   ->  sound_

            Also in Turbo C 1.5, Borland included macros for the text mode
            colors in GRAPHICS.H.  To provide compatibility with Turbo C 1.5,
            many of the macros for colors in the TCXL.H file have been renamed.
                YELLOW      ->  BROWN
                WHITE       ->  LGREY
                IBLACK      ->  DGREY
                IBLUE       ->  LBLUE
                IGREEN      ->  LGREEN
                ICYAN       ->  LCYAN
                IRED        ->  LRED
                IMAGENTA    ->  LMAGENTA
                IYELLOW     ->  YELLOW
                IWHITE      ->  WHITE
                _YELLOW     ->  _BROWN
                _WHITE      ->  _LGREY


Version 1.6:
            Added a new function.  See TCXL.DOC for description.
                tabstop - calculates the next tab stop from current cursor
                          location

            Fixed a problem in the sound() function that caused it not to work
            to work in some machines.

            Optimized performance of several functions.

                wunhide - reveals a previously hidden open window

            Revised/changed several functions.  See TCXL.DOC for full
            descriptions and examples.
                getchf  - now returns character typed but still provides
                          automatic checking for the Escape key
