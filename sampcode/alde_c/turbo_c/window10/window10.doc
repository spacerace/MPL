                      MULTI-LEVEL WINDOWS and Q UTILITIES
                               TURBO-C Version 1.0

        PURPOSE:

        This utility creates incredibly quick multi-level windows as
        library calls in Turbo-C programs for IBM PC/XT/AT compati-
        bles.  They work on MDA, CGA, and EGA adapters in any column mode
        (40/80/etc.).  This utility uses the quick screen writing utilities,
        also in library form.  Users are encouraged to participate in the free
        Teamware concept with the release of these functions. As of this 
        release all of the functions are available in WINDOW10.LIB. Once the
        library functions are commented they will be released as teamware.
        The Q utilities were transformed from TURBO PASCAL inline to
        external assembly using BORLAND's rules.asi macro assembler header
        file.


        TEST DRIVE:

        Compile and run the tutoring program WTUTOR10.C to get a feeling
        for features and speed. Also QDEMO10.C can be compiled to give the
        user a feel for features of the Q UTILITIES. The library functions
        and demos were compiled with the SMALL model and all ERRROR checking
        on.


        FILES:
                                                     
        In this version, WINDOW10.ARC contains:

           !_read.me!  :  File that insists you get a copy of WINDOW10.ARC.
           wtutor10.c  :  Demo of WINDOW10.LIB which also gives a tutorial
                          of user instructions.
           qdemo10.c   :  Demo of the Q UTILITIES also in WINDOW10.LIB.
           qbench10.c  :  A timing program that shows "screens/second" for
                          the Q utilities.
           wtutor10.exe:  Executable version of windowing demo 
           qdemo10.exe :  Executable version of Q UTILITIES
           qbench10.exe : Executable version of timing program
           qdemo10.prj :  Project file used to build qdemo10.exe
           wtutor10.prj:  Project file used to build wtutor10.exe
           qbench10.prj:  Project file used to build qbench10.exe
           window10.doc:  This document.
           qutil10.doc :  Document on Q UTILITIES
           wind10s.lib:  Library of window functions and Q UTILITIES.
                          WINDOW FUNCTIONS:  (see appendix)
                             wiattr(); creates color attribute on fore/back
                             initwindow(): initilizes window environment
                             makewindow(): makes a window on the screen 
                             titlewindow(): title a window with text
                             removewindow(); removes last window by make
                             scrollwindow(): scrolls a window up or down
                             qinit(): intialize Q utilities, DO not call
                                      if you call initwindow();
                         Q UTILITIES: (see qutil.doc)
           windprot.h  :  Header file with prototypes for all of the
                          functions in window10.lib.
           w1.h        :  Header file with type definitions.
           color.h     :  Header file with color definitions.

        IMPROVEMENTS:

       extern licurrent. -- Keeps track of the window currently being used.
       If you have more than one window displayed and want to swap the active
       window without removing it, two indexes are then required.
       licurrent can be changed by the user; li should not be changed.


        TEAMWARE:

        With the release of this utility, I hope to introduce the concept
        of Teamware.  These utilities are FREE, so don't worry.  Many pro-
        grammers have done some superior individual efforts and have
        benefited many.  But the problem is just that - they are individual
        efforts that as packages are not compatible with other individual
        efforts.  And many of the programs are released as copyrighted so
        that others cannot use them in certain contexts.  It seems that if
        users have other expertise and discover ways to combine each others
        utilities, the benefits can improve greatly.  This is what these
        utilities have done.

        As Teamware, users CAN and are encouraged to:

           1. Use the utilities to enhance their programs and applications
              in both private and commercial contexts.
           2. Combine, create, and edit other utilities and re-release them
              as Teamware by permission of the previous author(s)/editor(s).
           3. Enhance shareware programs provided they are applications that
              in no way represent or advertise the power of the utilities
              themselves, but shall credit the use of Teamware.
           4. Ask about questionable use of the utility.

        As Teamware, users CANNOT:

           1. Distribute the utilities for profit.
           2. Combine, create, and edit other utilities and re-release them
              as Shareware or for any profit as enhanced utilities.


        ADDITIONAL NOTES:

        Actual window routines are to be commented and released at a later
        date by the author.

***     Global variables zoomeffect and shadoweffect can be changed at any
        time to either zoom (explode) the window or put up a shadow. The
        shadow as of this version can either be left or rigt.

        WTUTOR10.C covers most of the instructions for use. For instance
        the window functions can work on up to 8 display pages depending
        on your video card.  Turbo-C functions only work on the first
        page, page 0.  This is where Q screen utilities come in.  They will
        work on any page.  Even though the window functions will seem to make
        a Turbo-C window on say page 3, the standard procedures of printf,
        fputf,puts, etc. will not work there.  You must then use Q
        screen utilities for those pages.

        There may be later versions of WINDOW1x.LIB, so use the latest one.

       Remember that a Turbo-C window cannot have less than 2 rows or
       columns.


        LIABILITY:

        No liabilities are assumed if the user misuses these utilities.
