               This library is based on the file DISPIO.ASM, which Brian
          H. Burger published in the article, "C to Assembly Interface", on
          pages 49-59 of the February, 1985 issue of "Computer Language". 
               DISPIO.ASM is the original program, with a few corrections
          and some modifications.  It contains Lattice C calls for all the
          BIOS video procedures, plus procedures to switch monitors.  Some
          of the procedures have two calls, one near assembly language and
          the other with more arguments but clearer.  I added calls only
          when the Greenleaf Functions did not have the second form.  The
          documentation for DISPIO also gives the Greenleaf Functions
          references.
               DISPIO.ASM is designed to work with Lattice C, which has its
          own method of interfacing to functions.  You may need to change
          or even rewrite it for a different compiler.
               The include file DISPIO.H contains constants which may help
          you use DISPIO.ASM and two macros which use it.
               DISPIOF.C contains many small functions which use
          DISPIO.ASM.  As I wrote them, I realized that they were also low
          level window functions, so I added some global variables to give
          window specifications.  DISP_PAR.H is an include file which will
          declare these variables extern in other modules.  Several of the
          functions in DISPIOF.C call major BIOS functions like change
          monitors and then reset these global variables.  Incidentally,
          the default window is the whole screen.  If you want others, you
          must write your own functions to save and restore the parameters
          and set the new ones.
               Since these are BIOS functions, they are quite fast.  Since
          they are not DOS functions, they do not support redirection.  I
          would expect you to use them only in those cases where you know
          that you are dealing with the screen.
               Two of the three remaining program files are addaptations of
          existing public domain functions to DISPIO.  I added a choice
          between a single and double line box to L. Cutherberson's
          FRAME.C.  I merely changed the name and call to the anonymous
          author's PRINTF.C.  In this case, use the original file for
          redirectible speed and the new D_PRINTF.C if you don't want to
          allow redirection.
               Finally, DISPIO.DOC contains documentation sheets for the
          functions.
               * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
               These functions are free for your use, as is, with no
          warantees of any kind.
