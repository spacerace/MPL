        Computer Language, Vol 2, No. 2 (February, 1985), published "C to
Assembly Interface", by Brian H. Burger, on pages 49-59.  Listings 1 and 2 of
that article each included a batch of garbage at their start.  File CASM.LBR
dutifully copied these listings exactly under the titles CASM.1 and CASM.2.  In
addition, it copied Listing 3 into CASM.3 and modified Listing 2 into CASM.4 to
demonstrate listing 3.

     The article contains two display interfaces for Lattice C.  I have
retitled the files to reflect the names of the programs, and I have added .OBJ
files for them.  The original test programs contained quite good #defines and
macros to use these programs.  I have broken them into include files DSPIO.H
and DISPIO.H and test files TDSPIO.C and TDISPIO.C.

        DSPIO is a simpler and smaller.  DISPIO is faster and has a cleaner
interface for setting the cursor position.
