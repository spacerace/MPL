            WINDOW.C -

            Window.c ia a simple window management library based on the article
            "A Simple Window Package" by  Edward Mitchell  in the  January 1984
            issue of  Dr. Dobb's Journal.  This implementation uses dynamically
            allocated buffers for window control blocks and screen save buffers
            instead of the fixed arrays used by Mitchell. Although this library
            is written  to be  used with  the DeSmet  C compiler, the only non-
            standard characteristic  of the source is that some of the function
            names are more than 8 characters long.

            VLIB.A -

            An assembly  language  support  library  called  VLIB  is  used  to
            interface the  DeSmet C  compiler  with  the  IBM  ROM  BIOS  video
            routines.  VLIB will undoubtedly have to be rewritten if the window
            package  is   to  be  used  with  other  compilers.  The  following
            paragraphs should  be of  help to  those folks  who must tread this
            path.

            The calling  convention for  DeSmet is to push parameters rightmost
            first then do an intrasegment call to the function. In other words,
            functions are NEAR procedures. Most other compilers do intersegment
            (FAR) calls to assembly language functions so their parameters will
            be 2 bytes farther away on the stack.

            Functions return  char's and  int's in  the AX register. Long's are
            returned in DX:AX.

            The compiler  adds an  underscore  character  to  the  end  of  all
            function names  so getmode() would become getmode_ in the assembler
            source.

            WNDEMO.C -

            Just what it says. WNDEMO shows how to open windows, write strings
            in them and close 'em.

            FINALLY -

            Since all  the windowing  functions go  through the  standard  BIOS
            calls, any display mode can be accommodated. The graphic modes will
            require more  attention from  the host  program than  was  paid  in
            WNDEMO, but  that (as is so often said) is left as an excercise for
            the reader (programmer).
