cc     sortof a unix cc command to compile/assemble and link sources.
     
    !(c) 1985 James Montebello (not copyrighted, no need to reproduce 
              this anywhere, do with the code what you will)

     this version of cc is intended to work with the Computer Innovations
     C86 compiler, IBM's MASM and IBM's LINK. 
     it shouldn't be too big a deal to get it to work with any c compiler.

     usage: cc [flags] file...
        file(s) can be .c's, .asm's, or .obj's. if
        no extension is given, .c is assumed. wildcards ok.

        flags:
        -ofile    file is where the linked output will be
                  placed. the 1st file in the list is the
                  assumed output if no -o present
        -lpath    path is the full path/filename of a 
                  library to be included in the list,
                  multiple libs can be in path, or several
                  -l's can be given
        -c    compile only, skip link step
        -C    regular C86 -c flag.
        all other c86 flags passed thru directly.
        most assembler and linker flags passed thru as well,
        do cc{ret} for these flags, most are simply capitalized.

        if no -h (c86 flag, path for includes) is given, the
        contents of the environment variable, CCINCLUDES
        will be used [note: like the c86 flag, this path
        must have an ending '\' or '/'.    If neither is present,
        /lib/include/ is assumed.

        the environment variables CCSLIB and CCBLIB should
        contain the path/filename of the small and big 
        libraries to be used for link. If the environment 
        variables are not present, /lib/c86s2s.lib and 
        /lib/c86b2s.lib are assumed.

        if you run out of environment space (only 128 bytes, indeed!),
        there is a public-domain program available widely called
        BOOT.EXE that allows you to increase your system environment
        up to 32K (theoretically). I wished I could remember the 
        name of the guy who wrote it and/or where I got it. Its
        really a swell utility.

        There is a bug someplace in the code that appears 
        intermittantly. cc may issue an error compiling
        a file when no error has occurred. Quite often it
        will appear before the command is issued. I can't seem
        to track it down; its driving me crazy.
