     compiler.  This program integrates the compiler into one command
     and simplifies use of the compiler.

     CC PROGRAM <-options> </link>

     This program supports any and all of the options doccumented in
     the 2.20 manual plus the /LINK option which will cause the program
     to be linked after the C compiler is done with it.

     To use the /LINK option, the program expects a symbol to exist
     in the environment space.  The symbol contains the path and names
     of the libraries you wish to include in the link.  If this
     symbol is not found, the program will prompt for the path.

     SET CRLIB=<path of C libraries>

     Please send any suggestions to me on this BBS and I will see
     what I can do with them. (Terrapin Station -- 612/623-0152)
