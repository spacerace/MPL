
Displays the running time and exit code of a program.

              Usage: timex <commandline>

Where <commandline>  is any COM or EXE program in the current
directory or command search path and its associated arguments
and parameters.     The timex command won't time BAT files or
resident DOS commands (COPY, e.g.).  Run time is displayed in
seconds to the nearest tenth,  and the exit code is displayed
as an eight-bit integer set off by parentheses.      Internal
resolution of the timer is ca. 0.055 seconds.  Timex displays
an abbreviated version of this document if it is invoked with 
no commandline arguments.
