comments as supported by BDS C. Option flags support
the following features:

- Routing of list output to disk
- Cross-referencing of reserved words
- Processing of nested include files
- Generation of listing only

Usage: xc <filename> <flag(s)>

Flags: -i            = Enable file inclusion
       -l            = Generate listing only
       -r            = Cross-ref reserved words
       -o <filename> = Write output to named file
