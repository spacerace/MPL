This is one of the better free "lint" type programs that I have come accross.
The only major fault that I can find with it is that it flags "else if" 
constructs as errors.  It also quits after ten errors - this can be changed
easily.  This program has been compiled by Aztec C v3.20c.  The module named
"ccheck.exe" has been compiled to run on an 8086/8088 processor.  The module
named "cch186.exe" has been compiled to run on an 80186/80286 processor.
