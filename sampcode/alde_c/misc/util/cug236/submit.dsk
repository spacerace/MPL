SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

Please avoid sub-directories, squeezed files, library files or other
compacted formats. CUG appreciates and prefers submissions with
cataloging headers on all text files (See sample below and refer
to CUG Newsletter II #6, March, 1985 for more details.)

SAMPLE HEADER
/*
HEADER:		;
TITLE:		Diskette sector editor;
VERSION:	1.4;

DESCRIPTION:	"Lets you view, edit and write back a diskette sector.

		It needs a 24*80 cursor-addressable terminal, and requires
		your custom CLRSCREEN() and GOTOXY() functions.  The
		definitions of these functions appear early in SE.C.

		Compiling requires SENTER.C, included on the diskette.
		Also included are SE.DOC and SE.SUB.";

KEYWORDS:	Disk, utility, editor, sector;
SYSTEM:		CP/M-80, V2.2;
FILENAME:	SE.C;
WARNINGS:	"Requires Version 2.x of CP/M.
		SE is not designed to work with systems using the DEBLOCK
		routine in the BIOS to handle physical sectors larger than
		128 bytes, so if you have such a system, and want to use SE,
		you must modify the routines in SE which write back the edited
		sector.  The BitMap command is not implemented.";

SEE-ALSO:	SE.DOC, SENTER.C;
AUTHORS:	Jan Larsson;
COMPILERS:	BDS C, v1.43 and 1.5a;
