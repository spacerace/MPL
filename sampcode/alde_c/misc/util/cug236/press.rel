                 Press Release for C Users' Group Starter Disk

     This disk is the result of an effort to produce a disk of very portable 
programs that people new to the group can compile and run with minimal hassle.  
The programs almost all exist in other library volumes, but they suffered from 
portability problems in their original forms.  The effort required to render a 
program portable ranged from moderate (the MSDOS programs) to severe (the BDS C 
programs).

     The objective of the effort has been realized as far as I can validate the 
programs with one notable exception.  BAWK has a very deeply ingrained 
dependency on the truth of the statement sizeof(int) == sizeof(char *).  It 
will require a person experienced in compiler/interpreter writing to remove 
this dependency as it involves changing BAWK's runtime interpreter from weakly 
typed (like BDS C) to strongly typed (like modern C compilers).  The upshot is 
that BAWK will not work under the MSDOS large model, though it will work under 
the MSDOS small model.

     I was able to compile and run every program on the disk in the following 
environments:

     1)   AZTEC C II / CP/M 2.2

     2)   Eco-C / CP/M 2.2 (except BAWK which overflowed the linker's memory)

     3)   Eco-C88 / MSDOS 3.1 (except BAWK which brought a strange error 
               message that I can't decipher from the compiler's code 
               generator)

     4)   Microsoft C 3.0 (small model) / MSDOS 2.0

     5)   Microsoft C 3.0 (large model) / MSDOS 2.0 (except BAWK -- see above)

     A few minor tweaks were required, but these have been documented at the 
top of each program as switches that can be flipped by uncommenting #define 
directives.

     On to the contents of the disk.....

     1)   2UP       Rearranges text from single-column format to multi-column 
                    format.

     2)   BAWK      A GREP-based text pattern search and replace facility.

     3)   CB        Arranges curly-braces, indentation, and so forth of a C 
                    program source into a rather readable form.

     4)   CFLOW     Lists function definitions and function calls of a C 
                    program source so that one can see who calls what.

     5)   FCOMP     A rather intelligent text file comparator.

     6)   HEAD      Lists the first n lines of each file in a list of text 
                    files.

     7)   PLCHECK   Shows the indentation level of each line of a C program 
                    source.

     8)   RETAB     A combination of DETAB and ENTAB.  Detabifies a file then 
                    entabifies it with a (possibly) different tab increment 
                    without changing the file's appearence.

     9)   RETABF    Same as RETAB except that it works from stdin to stdout 
                    instead of between two named files.

     10)  RS232EXP  Conducts a question-and-answer session about RS-232 comm 
                    link problems.

     11)  SGREP     A different GREP-based text pattern search and replace 
                    facility.

     12)  TEE       Takes snapshots of the contents of pipelines in "pipe-
                    fitting" applications.

     13)  XC        Cross-references a C program source.

     In the course of this project, I discovered that, while the C language 
will allow one to write quite portable code, most of you out there don't do so. 
That makes your efforts almost useless to people who aren't running exactly 
your environment.  How do you write portable code?  Watch this space in future 
issues.

     You are encouraged to validate these programs under environments that are 
not available to me.  If you tell me what modifications you've had to make to 
the package to get it to work for you, I can incorporate them into future 
releases of the package.  That way, others will not have to rediscover what you 
have learned.  In particular, if some enterprising compiler hacker will improve 
BAWK's interpreter.....
