Format:

     tee filename

Purpose:

TEE is a text filter that passes the standard input to a designated file (or 
MS-DOS device) in addition to passing it unchanged to the standard output.

Examples:

Copy the file named original to two new files, newfile1 and newfile2.

     tee newfile1 <original >newfile2

Echo what is typed at the keyboard onto the screen, while saving the characters
to a file named record.

     tee record                         

Copy the file named original to a new file (newfile), while printing the 
contents of original on the printer.

     tee newfile <original >prn 

Take the directory, display it on the screen, save the directory to the file 
named dirlist, sort the directory, and place the sorted directory in the file 
named dirsort.

     dir | tee con | tee dirlist | sort > dirsort
