	CFLOW --
		a program to reveal C program structure 
		 		  by Mark Ellington

	In exploring the many C programs available in the public
	domain you may discover that many are poorly commented
	(if at all) and use difficult to decipher program structure
	It may be hard to remember how your own programs work when
	they are not fresh in your mind.  If you want to change a 
	module what will happen to other functions that use it, 
	and which ones are they? 

	This program, CFLOW, accepts a C source file as input
	and generates as output to STDOUT a roughly structured
	listing of module (function) declarations and the function
	calls within them.

	The listing is vertically structured according to sequence,
	with each module call encountered (i.e. printf(---)) listed
	on a new line.  The horizontal structuring is strictly in
	accordance with the level of open braces "{" at the time
	the module call is read, and is developed by sending one
	horizontal tab for each open level at the time the function
	call is read.  A function declaration (where the function
	and its variables are declared) will always be at braces 
	level 0 and will be at the left margin.  For convenience
	the module declarations are preceded by "**" on the line
	above and include their variable declarations.
	
	Nesting without braces, as within a multiple level "if"
	construct, is not revealed by CFLOW.  Include files are
	ignored as are "#define" macros.  

	To use cflow, simply type in:

		 "CFLOW FILENAME.EXT"  

	Use the complete filename (drive and extension).  The 
	structure listing will be sent to the screen.  To get a
	printed listing, use the host operating system's (or
	compiler's) I/O redirection facilities to redirect stdout
	to your printer.  Under MSDOS, it goes like this:

		"CFLOW FILENAME.EXT >PRN"

	Under CP/M or MSDOS, you can use control-P (also control-
	PrtSc under MSDOS) and send to the console as usual.  To
	route the listing to a disk file type:

		"CFLOW FILENAME.EXT >LISTFILE.EXT"
