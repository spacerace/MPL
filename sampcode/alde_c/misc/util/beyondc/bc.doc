     INTRODUCTION
     
     BeyondCompare is a line-by-line file comparator.  It compares two text
     files and then shows you the differences.  BeyondCompare is particularly
     useful for comparing two source code files or two textual documents.
     BeyondCompare accepts the names of two files as input.  Typically, the two
     files are actually different versions of the same file - an old version and
     a new version.
     
     In comparing two files, BeyondCompare repeatedly looks for consecutive
     lines of text that are identical in both files (matching sections), and
     then reports the lines between the matching sections as differences.  The
     differences are expressed as the changes, insertions, and deletions that
     can be applied to the old version to make it identical to the new version.
     BeyondCompare was designed to produce an excellent report of the
     differences while keeping the execution time to a minimum.
     
     The "recursive longest matching sequence" algorithm, which was pioneered by
     BeyondCompare, is described in the September, 1987 issue of Dr. Dobb's
     Journal.
