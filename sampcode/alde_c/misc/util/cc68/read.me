This compiler is an optimizing C compiler for the Motorola 68000 processor.
It has successfully compiled itself on UNIX system V running on a Motorola
VME-10. Since this code was written for a machine with long integers it may
exhibit some irregularity when dealing with long integers on the IBM-PC.
The author makes no guarantees. This is not meant as a serious developement
tool although it could, with little work, be made into one. The bugs and
limitations of this compiler are listed below:

	-Although you may declare floating point types the code generator does
		not know how to deal with them. They should therefore be avoided.
	
	-The preprocessor does not support arguments to #define'd macros or
		any of #line #ifdef... etc. Only #include and #define are supported.
	
	-Function arguments declared as char may not work properly. Declare
		them as int.
	
	-The size of functions is slightly limited due to the fact that the
		entire function is parsed before any code is generated.
	
	-The output of the compiler is in the UNIX 68000 assembler format.

To run the compiler type "cc68 sieve.c". This will compile the program sieve
and produce two files; sieve.lis is a source listing with a symbol type
reference; sieve.s is the 68000 assembly language produced.

The file lib.s is the assembly source for some runtime support routines
which must be loaded with the final code. The is no standard runtime library
support.

The compiler can be compiled by microsoft C version 3.0 or higher. MSC will
issue lots of warnings but they can be ignored. The file make.bat will
rebuild the compiler if MSC is available.
