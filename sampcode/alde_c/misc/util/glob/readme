  Here is a routine which does wildcard expansion for MS-DOS.
It could be spiffed up by using the regex routines by Henry Spencer, but
for now it expands DOS style wildcards (*,?):  (This is also found in
the file example.c)


 #include "glob.h"
 main() {
 	char **names;
 	names = glob("*.c");
 	if (names)
 	    printf("The first file which matches the wildcard: %s\n",names[0]);
 	else
 	    printf("glob() error number %d\n",globerror);
 }

It also handles the case of "/usr/pl*/bin/*.exe" where "/usr/pl*/bin" is unique.
Unfortunately, the code does not handle "/*/*/*.c" type expansions.  This is
an arbitrary limitation which is left to the student to implement. :-)))))

It also does not handle "C:/bin/*.exe"  - the drive spec fouls it up,
MS-DOS seems to have problems with the find first/next functions in the
root directory so "/*.c" may give you problems.

The shar which follows contains:
	glob.c  glob.h		- the actual wildcard expansion routines
	example.c		- a very simple example of its usage
	chd.c			- a more complex example - implements chdir
	chd.exe (uuencoded)	- compiled version of chd.c
	glob.obj (uuencoded)	- linkable module containing glob()

Have fun, mail me if you have problems...

(PS I am not actively using MS-DOS for now, so this code has been sitting 
"on the shelf" for a bit.  I saw a few comments in comp.sys.ibm.pc concerning
Turbo C and its lack of wildcard support, so I figured I'd send this out.)
