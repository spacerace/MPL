; Comment lines begin with ; or *
; All blank lines are ignored
; If you want a blank line in the function or info area, enter // at the
;	beginning of the line
; Maximum number of FUNCTION KEYS = 12
; Maximum lines above the function = 4
; There are three columns of information area
; Maximum characters per column = 35
; Maximum lines of info = 15
; mode lines are .cx (columns 1-3) for the info lines
;  		 .fx (keys 1-15) for the function keys
;		 .t for the title line
;
; The only requirements are: 
;	When a mode is set, the subsequent lines of data are for that mode.  
;		Until the mode is changed.	
;	Text cannot go on the same line as the mode set command
;
; All data does not have to be in any order and may skip around.
;
; Example .c1 sets the mode for data into column 1. The next lines of data
;	will be under that column.  If the same column is set again, the
;       data will continue.
