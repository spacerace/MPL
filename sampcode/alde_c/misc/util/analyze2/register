                             USER SUPPORTED SOFTWARE
                             -----------------------



         A word about user supported software:

         The user supported software  concept  (usually referred to as
         freeware) is an attempt to provide software at low cost.  The
         cost of offering a  new  product  by  conventional  means  is
         staggering, and hence dissuades many independent authors  and
         small companies from developing  and  promoting  their ideas.
         User supported software  is  an  attempt  to  develop  a  new
         marketing channel, where products can be  introduced  at  low
         cost.

         If user supported software works, then everyone will benefit.
         The user will benefit by receiving quality  products  at  low
         cost, and by being able to "test drive"  software  thoroughly
         before purchasing it.  The author benefits by  being able  to
         enter the commercial software  arena  without  first  needing
         large sources of venture capital.

         But it can only work  with  your  support.   We're  not  just
         talking about Analyze  here,  but  about  all  user supported
         software.  If you find that you are  still  using  a  program
         after a couple of weeks, then pretty obviously  it  is  worth
         something to you, and you should register.
