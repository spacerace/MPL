                    Steve's C Function Library for Datalight C


         I. INTRODUCTION
                 The heart  of  the  C  language  is  its  library.  Each
         compiler  has  its  own  library of functions, which is complete
         only to the degree that the compiler author wishes to  make  it.
         The  Datalight  C  Compiler  is  an  excellent product which has
         gotten rave reviews in computer magazines. (I have both  Lattice
         3.1  and Datalight available to me and I prefer the Datalight by
         far.) The greatest criticism which can be leveled  at  Datalight
         is  the  size  of  its  library.  It  has  all  the  usual basic
         functions, plus some nice unique features. But it still can  use
         some help. Enter Steve's Library! At over 70 functions (for now)
         my  library  greatly enhances program development with Datalight
         C. Don't have Datalight? Well, most C  compilers  use  the  same
         calling conventions and it is highly probable that the functions
         of  this library may be used. If you have the source, be certain
         by re-compiling the C modules. Assembly  language  modules  will
         probably have to be altered to work with other compilers.




         II. THE DOCUMENTATION
                 The  documentation  for  the  library  is contained in a
         number  of .DOC  files,  which  describe  each  function.   When
         printed,  these  pages  may  be  placed in a standard three-ring
         binder. A utility program, PMAN.COM is provided to generate  the
         entire  set  of documents. PMAN requires the file LISTALL, which
         may be edited to eliminate printing of certain files if desired.
         (PMAN is copyrighted, but placed in the public domain.)
                 To print the DOC files, you must be in a  directory  (or
         on  a  floppy)  containing PMAN, LISTALL, and all the DOC files.
         Just type "PMAN" at your system prompt and  the  files  will  be
         printed to PRN:.

         III. INSTALLATION

         Steve's Library is distributed as four library  files  for  each
         type  of  memory  model. (Only the full registration with source
         has all four libraries.) The filenames are:
              SMDLS.LIB       Small Memory Model
              SMDLD.LIB       Large Data Model
              SMDLP.LIB       Large Code Model
              SMDLL.LIB       Large Code and Data Model
         For the remainder of this manual the libraries will be  referred
         to as SMDLx.LIB.
         A  typical hard disk installation of Datalight will consist of a
         directory named  \DC  in  which  will  be  found  the  compiler,
         Datalight  libraries,  and  Datalight  header  files.  SMDLx.LIB
         should be copied into this directory as well, or  into  whatever
         directory the Datalight libraries have been installed.
         Steve's  Library  also  includes several header files which list
         "define"s for many useful items. These  header  files  are  also
         required  to re-compile the source for the libraries. The header
         files should be copied into the \DC directory,  or  in  whatever
         other  directory  contains  stdio.h, dos.h, and the other header
         files. If you have purchased the source files and wish  to  have
         them  on  hard  disk, make a new subdirectory under the \DC main
         directory called SM (C:\DC\SM) and copy all source files to that
         directory.

         IV. LINKING
                 The  SMDLx.LIB  library  must  be  linked with any other
         libraries whenever a function is  used  in  your  program.  Some
         programs  may  not  use  SMDLx.LIB  functions, and therefore the
         linking of the library may  be  eliminated  to  save  time.  The
         Datalight driver (DLC) command line would look like this:
                 DLC MYPROGRAM \DC\SMDLS.LIB
         Naturally,  if  your  directory  structure  is not the standard,
         specify the paths as needed. In  addition,  if  you  have  other
         third party libraries, be sure to include them after SMDLx.LIB.

         V. INTERRUPT HANDLER FUNCTIONS
                 A special feature of  Steve's  Library  is  the  various
         interrupt handler functions. These are:
               ticker
               ctlbrk
               criterr
         These  functions  provide  the  programmer  with  the ability to
         install  a  special  routine  to  intercept  one  of   the   DOS
         interrupts.  ctlbrk()  installs  a  user-defined  routine  to be
         executed whenever a control-break  is  typed  on  the  keyboard.
         criterr()  traps  the  DOS  critical error handler (the one that
         says Abort, Retry, etc.) and allows the programmer to substitute
         his own  handler.  ticker()  is  not  really  a  user  definable
         handler,  but  a  pre-built  handler  which  allows  the user to
         perform operations relative to the  system's  clock.  A  special
         variable  may  be  loaded  with  a  value  and  then  tested  at
         intervals. When the variable has hit zero, a specific amount  of
         time  has passed. The variable counts 18.2 times per second, and
         is installed on INT 1CH.
         The usage of these interrupt handlers is  slightly  complex  and
         interactive.  For  example,  if  you  use  ticker() you must use
         ctlbrk() and you may have to use criterr().  It  has  been  said
         that  a picture is worth a thousand words. Well, to me, a source
         file is worth a whole chapter of tutorial. Therefore,  refer  to
         TESTINTS.C,  which is supplied with all distributions of Steve's
         Library, to see a heavily commented source code file which  uses
         these  interrupts. This program may be compiled and run to watch
         the result.

         VI. THE UTILITIES
                 Beginning with Release 1.20 of my library, I am shipping
         the  source  code  for several utiltiies I have written. Nothing
         earth shaking here, just some convenient programs to make life a
         little easier. All  the  programs  use  several  functions  from
         Steve's  Library,  and  can serve as an example of proper usage.
         Here is a short description of each utility:

                                      INPATH

                 This utility searches for an EXECUTABLE program  in  the
         current  path.  Typing INPATH at the DOS prompt will display the
         version number and a short usage message. To use, type:

               inpath <filename>

         where filename is the basename portion of the executable file to
         find. Note that  an  extension  can  be  specified,  but  it  is
         ignored.  INPATH  will  first  look  for the file in the current
         directory, and then look in the PATH environment variable (if it
         is present) in the order specified. For each  directory,  INPATH
         first tries to locate a .COM file, then a .EXE file, then a .BAT
         file,  since  that is the order in which DOS searches for files.
         On the first  match,  INPATH  reports  the  directory  and  full
         filename  of the program and then exits. If none are found, that
         fact is reported.

         INPATH demonstrates the use of newext() and error().


                                        TC

                 This is a quick Text  Compare  program  to  compare  two
         ASCII  files.  Typing  TC  at  the  DOS  prompt will display the
         version number and a short usage message. To use, type:

               tc file1 file2

         where file1 and file2 are the two files to compare. If the files
         are identical, no more  messages  will  appear.  Otherwise,  the
         program  will  report  any  lines  which  are different with the
         filename, line number, and a printout of the actual line. If one
         file ends before the  other,  the  program  reports  which  file
         terminated first.

         TC demonstrates the use of error() and cant().

                                        WC

                 WC counts words, lines, characters, and checksums one or
         more files. Typing WC at the DOS prompt will display the version
         number and a short usage message. To use, type:

                wc filename [-wcls]

         where filename is the name of the file  to  act  upon.  With  no
         options, the program will report words, characters, lines, and a
         checksum,  which  is  a  simple binary addition of all character
         values. No, it ain't a CRC, but it is a quick check to see if it
         the same as another file under the same name. The options [wcls]
         tell the program to report ONLY the items specified:

              -w     report only words
              -l     report only lines
              -c     report only characters
              -s     report only checksum

         Note that giving all options is the same as giving no options.

         Since words, lines, and characters are meaningless in a non-text
         file, the program examines the filename extension  to  determine
         if  the  file  is  a  binary  or text file. This isn't a perfect
         method, but it is good enough. If the file  extension  is  .COM,
         .EXE, .OBJ, .REL, .PFS, .LIB, or .BIN, then only the checksum is
         reported,  overriding  all  other  options. The program supports
         wildcards in the filename, as well as drives and directories.

         WC demonstrates the use of exttyp(), cant(),  and  the  wildcard
         _main object file by Datalight.

                                      OKISET

                 This  program  is  used  to  set  the  printing  options
         available  on  an Okidata ML84 (with IBM Plug 'n' Play), or most
         other IBM compatible printers. It may be easily  customized  for
         other  printers.  This  is  a  menu  driven program requiring no
         options. Just execute it and follow the directions!


              F1    PITCH
              Use the SPACE key to toggle between  normal  (10  cpi)
              and  condensed  (17.5 cpi) pitch. Press RETURN to make
              the selection.

              F2    STYLE Use the SPACE key to toggle between  draft
              and letter quality style, and press RETURN to select.

              F3    LQ  SPACING  Enter  1  or  2 digits in the range
              00-11 to select letter quality  spacing.  ESCape  will
              abort  this  entry,  BACKSPACE will allow you to start
              the entry over, and RETURN selects the entered  value.
              This selection assumes letter quality mode, and forces
              the style to letter quality, and the pitch to 10 cpi.

              F4    LINES  PER PAGE Enter 1 or 2 digits in the range
              01-99 to set  the  page  length  in  lines  per  page.
              ESCape, BACKSPACE, and RETURN operate as for F3.

              F5    LINE  SPACING  Use SPACE key to toggle between 6
              LPI and 8 LPI spacing, and press RETURN to select.

              F7    OUTPUT CHANNEL Use SPACE  key  to  step  through
              output  channels  PRN, LPT1, and LPT2. Press RETURN to
              select.

              F9    NORMAL OPTIONS This key sets all  other  options
              as  follows:      pitch  >  10  CPI      style > Draft
                  lines > 66     space > 6 LPI     output > PRN

              F10    SEND CONTROL CODES and EXIT  No  control  codes
              are sent until this key is pressed. Only control codes
              which  have  been  selected  are  sent.  If  the pitch
              selection remains blank in the menu, for example,  the
              pitch  control code will not be sent. This allows only
              some options to  be  changed  without  disturbing  the
              existing printer configuration.
         Letter  quality  and  condensed  modes  cannot  be  mixed on the
         printer. Therefore, if a conflicting selection is made, the last
         entry will force correct options.

         OKISET will present various beeps for  invalid  keystrokes,  and
         warning messages where appropriate.

         OKISET  will  demonstrate  cls(),  mkbox(),  d_say(),  getkey(),
         d_pos(),  and  show  how  to  manage  a  non-scrolling  program.
         Programming idea: re-write this program using the  direct  video
         access routines.


                                       GTOD

                 This  utility  will  report  the current system time and
         date in a variety of  formats.  GTOD  may  be  invoked  with  or
         without options. Options may be preceeded by dash, fraction bar,
         or nothing at all.

                gtod <options>

              -d     report only date
              -t     report only time
              -e     report date in Eurpoean format (DD/MM/YY)
              -s     report seconds, if time reporting enabled
              -r     reverse reporting order, with time first and date second
              -l     spell out month in long format
              -n     if option -l, then add name of weekday
              -m     report time in 24 hour (military) format
              -v     report version number
              -?     usage message and exit
              no options defaults to -dt
         Output may be redirected to a file or another device, except for
         error messages.

         GTOD  demonstrates  the  rather  obscure  Datalight system clock
         interface, as well as error(), monthis(), wkdayname(), i_dstr(),
         and weekday(). Program idea: allow calculation  for  other  time
         zones.

                                       DUMP

                 (Oh! No! Not aNOTHer file dump utility!) Well, yes,  and
         I  apologize  all  to  h*ll.  However, this one started out as a
         utility supplied with the Datalight compiler, which I hacked  to
         death.  First,  it  will be in **COLOR** if it senses a CGA card
         installed, and will use blinks and highlights if a mono card  is
         sensed.  Second,  it  fixes  a  minor  bug or two in Datalight's
         version.  Third,  and  here  comes  the  unique  part,  it  will
         highlight  any  selected  byte  whenever  it is found! (Well, at
         least I think it's handy.) Fourth, it displays only 20 lines  at
         a  time and waits for a keypress to continue. Invoke the program
         as follows:

                dump filename <offset> <byte>

         where filename is the file to dump, offset  is  the  hex  offset
         value  in  which to index into the file before dumping (defaults
         is 0000), and byte is the hex value to highlight (default is  no
         highlight).  The  parameters MUST be in the order specified, and
         the offset must be supplied (as a  place  holder)  if  the  byte
         option is desired.

         DUMP  demonstrates  the  use of getkey(), stuff(), error(), plus
         many of the disp* functions of this library and  Datalight,  and
         the use of color attributes. Programming idea: there are several
         ways to increase the speed of the program. I haven't implemented
         them  so  that  you  can have the fun(!!) of doing it. Hint: the
         overhead in printf() is horrendous.

         VII. ON BUFFERING STDOUT
                 Beginning  with  Version  3.*  of Datalight, the authors
         have decided to buffer the output to stdout.  Well,  this  ain't
         quite  right,  thinks  me.  The  result is that any data sent to
         stdout (usually the console) is held up until (a) the buffer  is
         full,  (b) a newline character is sent, or (c) fflush(stdout) is
         called. This is a royal pain, but it can be  fixed.  The  module
         IOB.C  can be modified to set _IONBF in the stdout definition. I
         have included a source module, IOBNBF.C, with this modification.
         It can be renamed to IOB.C and recompiled  if  desired.  Use  an
         object  module  librarian  program  to replace the module in the
         Datalight libraries. Or, simply leave it as an OBJ file and link
         it into your programs. Since the linker will see it  before  the
         same  module  in the library, it will then take precedence. This
         may actually be better, since it gives you the  ability  to  use
         either   buffered  or  unbuffered  stdout  output.  All  of  the
         utilities  I  supply  with  my  library  are  designed  to   use
         unbuffered output.

         VIII. SHAREWARE AND COMMERCIAL LICENSING
                 By now, the shareware concept should be familiar  to  PC
         users.   In   a   nutshell,  ShareWare  is  "try-before-you-buy"
         software, reasonably  priced  and  user-supported.  This  simply
         means  that  you can get ShareWare software for free from anyone
         who has a copy, or often from bulletin board systems. If you use
         and like the program, then the  author  requests  a  payment  to
         support  further  software  development. By registering you will
         often also receive notice of available upgrades or  supplemental
         programs.  Of  course, payment under ShareWare is voluntary, but
         if the program is useful and the price is right, why not pay the
         dues and provide the incentive and reward necessary to  continue
         development of new and better software?
                 Steve's Library is shareware. If you like it and use it,
         please  register  your copy on the registration form enclosed at
         the end of this manual. You will be placed on a mailing list for
         future upgrades, and receive the most recent distribution  disk.
         For a slightly higher charge, you may elect to obtain the source
         code  for  all  functions, and the D, L, and P libraries. Please
         note that the extra  libraries  and  the  source  code  are  NOT
         SHAREWARE,   and   should   not   be   distributed.   Only   the
         documentation, header files, and  Small  model  library  may  be
         passed on under the shareware concept.
                 Online  help  is available through CompuServe, either by
         using EasyPlex or a message in IBMSW or IBMHW forums. Sorry, but
         online help is available ONLY to registered users.
                 Help is also available by mail. I will try to answer all
         letters within 48 hours. Non-registered  users  must  include  a
         SASE for a reply. The degree of help available to non-registered
         users is purely discretionary.
                 Steve's Library may be used in a commercial environment,
         with  no  royalties  required  to  include  functions  in  other
         programs offered for sale. However, the  library,  source  code,
         and  all  related  documentation  may  not  be  sold  under  any
         circumstances without my prior approval. Public Domain/Shareware
         distributors and Users Groups  may  charge  a  nominal  fee  for
         copying  and  distributing  those files which are shareware, and
         Bulletin Board Systems may  likewise  carry  the  files.  Please
         contact  me  for  a  complimentary  copy  to insure that you are
         offering the most recent and complete release. The  source  code
         may NOT be offered for sale or trade by other than myself.
                 Steve's   Library  and  its  documentation  may  not  be
         transferred nor exchanged in any modified form.  If  you  really
         want  to "hack" the functions or the documentation, by all means
         do so; but don't give the  hacked  version  to  anyone  else.  I
         cannot  be  expected  to help others use these functions if they
         are not the same as distributed. Under no circumstances may  the
         copyright  notices  be  altered or removed from the functions or
         documentation.

         VII. WARRANTY
                 Oh,  this  shouldn't  be  necessary  among  friends  and
         gentlemen, but it's really the lawyers who  run  the  world  and
         they say we gotta do this:

         VIII. And Now A Word From The Author...
                 I  hope  that  you  will  use  these functions in your C
         programs. They simplify life  and  expedite  the  production  of
         quality  programs.  Even  if  you do not decide to register, I'd
         like to hear your comments on these functions and documentation.
                 If you are not already a registered user of  one  of  my
         programs,  a  business-sized  SASE  will  bring  you  a  list of
         currently available programs from me.
