                dup -- duplicate a file handle

        SYNOPSIS
                nfh = dup(fh);
                int nfh;      new file handle
                int fh;       existing file handle


        DESCRIPTION
        This function uses the DOS "dup" function to create a duplicate
        of an existing file handle.  The new file handle returned is
        NULL if the dup process failed for any reason.  The use of
        a duplicate file handle is primarily for causing an open
        file to be "updated" to disk without closing and re-opening
        it.  This is done by first flushing any buffered data out,
        creating a duplicate file handle, and then closing the duplicate.
        The original file handle is left unchanged, but the disk
        directory and FAT are properly updated.



        EXAMPLE
              (assume that fd is a previously opened FILE *fd)

              update_file() {
                 int fh, nfh;
                 fh = fileno(fd);      /* get the file handle */
                 nfh = dup(fh);        /* get a duplicate handle */
                 if(nfh == 0) return;  /* duplicate failed */
                 fflush(fd);           /* insure all data written */
                 close(nfh);           /* close duplicate handle */
                 }
