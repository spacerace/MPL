                _getdi -- get device information for file handle

        SYNOPSIS
                r = _getdi(fh);
                int r;      status byte, low 8 bits only
                int fh;     DOS file handle to investigate


        DESCRIPTION
        This function returns the lower 8 bits of the control word for
        the specified file handle, usually stdout, stdin, or one of the
        other standard channels.  Note that a file handle, NOT file
        descriptor is required.  Refer to the DOS manual for the
        description of all the bits. Bit 7 set indicates a character
        device, and bits 0,1 refer to the console.  This function
        is called by the functions isatty() and iscons().


        EXAMPLE
              int r;
              int fh;
              fh = fileno(stdout);    /* get file handle for stdout */
              r = _getdi(fh);
              if(r >= 0x80) printf("stdout is a character device");
