                kbhit -- check keyboard (stdin) for character available

        SYNOPSIS
                r = kbhit();
                int r;


        DESCRIPTION
        This function returns TRUE (not 0) if a character is available
        from keyboard (stdin).  This function will not recognize a character
        which was replaced with ungetc().  If stdin is redirected from
        a file, this function will likely always return TRUE.




        EXAMPLE

                if(kbhit()) puts("There is a character waiting");
