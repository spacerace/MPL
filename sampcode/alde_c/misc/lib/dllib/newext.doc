                newext -- change a filename extension

        SYNOPSIS
                void newext(old, new, extn);
                char *old       original filename string
                char *new       destination for new filename
                char *extn      new extension string

        DESCRIPTION
        This function will make a new filename from an existing
        filename and a specified extension string.  The original
        filename string is left unchanged, since its base is copied to a
        new string area.  Nothing is returned.

        EXAMPLE
             char old[]={"FOOBAR.COM"};
             char new[14];

             newext(old, new, "BIN");


        After operation, the filename string in "new" will be:
             FOOBAR.BIN

        Character strings are NULL terminated.  The original string
        need not have any extension or period terminator, and may
        contain a path specifier.  Note that the destination string
        area must be long enough to hold the new filename.






        This function is found in SMDLx.LIB for the Datalight Compiler.
