                cursor_style -- alter the cursor style

        SYNOPSIS
                void cursor_style(type, startscan, stopscan);
                int type;         type of cursor as defined below
                int startscan;    top scanline of cursor
                int stopscan;     bottom scanline of cursor


        DESCRIPTION
        This function allows selection of several pre-defined cursor
        styles, or user-specified cursor size.  If "type" is 0, then
        user must supply a starting scanline and stopping scanline
        value.  If "type is 1-5, then these values may be set to
        anything to simply satisfy the argument count.  Cursor
        scanlines are numbered from the top (0) to the bottom, which
        is 7 for CGA boards, and 13 for Monochrome Adapters.  The
        Predefined values are:
            type == 1      Normal underline cursor for CGA
            type == 2      same, Mono Adapter
            type == 3      Block cursor for CGA
            type == 4      same, Mono Adapter
            type == 5      Cursor becomes invisible


        EXAMPLE

             /* for CGA video modes: */
            cursor_style(4, 0, 0);    /* set block cursor */
            cursor_style(1, 0, 0);    /* restore underline cursor */
            cursor_style(0, 1, 7);    /* set a very large block cursor */
