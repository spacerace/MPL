               daynum -- find the number of a date within a year

       SYNOPSIS
               value = daynum(month, day, year);
               int value;      number 1-366
               int month;      month number 1-12
               int day;        date of the month 1-31
               int year;       year, starting at 1980

       DESCRIPTION
       This function returns the day number, 1-366, for the given
       date.  By itself, this is not very useful, but the function is
       used as an intermediate calculation in certain other date routines.
       Years below 1980 are ignored.  The year value is used to determine
       status as leap year.

       EXAMPLE

              for July 2, 1986:

              int value;
              value = daynum(7, 2, 1986);
