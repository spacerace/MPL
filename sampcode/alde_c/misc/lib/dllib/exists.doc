                exists -- see if a file exists

        SYNOPSIS
                r = exists(name);
                int r;          returns FALSE if not found, else TRUE
                char *name;     filename to check


        DESCRIPTION
        If the specified filename, which may include drive and
        directory, is not found, then a value of zero (FALSE)
        is returned.  Else, one (TRUE) is returned.  This
        test does not take into consideration any attributes on
        the file, so that an fopen() call may still fail later.


        EXAMPLE
    
               if(exists("a:foo.bar")) puts("File exists!");
               else puts("File does not exist");
