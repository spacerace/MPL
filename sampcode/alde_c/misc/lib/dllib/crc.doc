               crc functions -- crc misc. functions

       SYNOPSIS
               short crc_clear();       clear crc value
               crc_update(crc, chr);    update crc value
               short crc_finish(crc);   finish crc calculation

       DESCRIPTION
       These functions are used in crc calculations mainly for
       modem programs.  crc_clear is used to clear the crc value.
       However, if speed is a concern, just zero the crc value since
       crc_clear does nothing other than return a zero.
       crc_update is called once for each character to add to the crc.
       It receives the running crc and the character to be added.
       crc_finish actually calls crc_update twice with a value of
       0 in order to flush the 16 bit calculation and return the final crc
       calculation.

       EXAMPLE
              short crc;
              crc = crc_clear();
              /* for each character processed: */
              crc = crc_update(crc, next_chr);
              /* finally, */
              crc = crc_finish;
