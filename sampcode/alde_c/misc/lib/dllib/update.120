Steve's Library, Version 1.20, 3-29-87

This wasn't supposed to be a real release at this time, but
Datalight has just brought out Version 3.01 and the Optimum C
optimizer, and I did have some new functions I've been using
which I wanted to add.  So, here is the next release, but only
the function description documentation has been updated, not the
manual.  (Note: There WAS a release 1.10, but 1.20 was ready before
anyone registered 1.10, so these are all changes from 1.00 to 1.20.)

New Functions Added:
    pr_*       Printer Functions
    blpr       BIOS Printer Write
    blprstat   BIOS Printer Status
    dup        Duplicate File Handle
    async      5 primitive (i.e., low level) async port functions
    enter*     Several routines to enter strings from keyboard,
               with editing and syntax checking.

Deleted:
    getvec     Datalight now supplies this as "int_getvector"
    isatty     Datalight now supplies this as "isatty"
    getver     Version number is now in globals "_osmajor" and "_osminor"

Bugs Fixed:
    mkbox
    disp_box   Fixed error which occurs if coordinates weren't 0,0
    criterr    Allows passing of DS register now

Docs Corrected:
    getdata.doc  Parameters for segment and offset were reversed

Headers Expanded:
    smdefs.h
    screen.h

All libraries have been recompiled with the Optimum C optimizer.
