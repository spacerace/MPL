        DESCRIPTION
        This function uses the features of Datalight's display
        package functions, and therefore, must follow the rules
        laid down by Datalight for their use.  Specifically,
        disp_open() must be called prior to using this function,
        and the functions may fail of the target system is not a
        very close compatible since direct memory writing is being
        used.  disp_box places a single line or double line box on the
        screen with the upper left corner anchored at "row" and "column",
        with the size denoted by the "height" and "width" values.
        No error checking is done on any value.  Invalid values may have
        unpredictable results.


        EXAMPLE

              int i;
              disp_open();    /* initialize the package */
              disp_cls();     /* clear the screen */
              disp_box(0, 0, 80, 24, 1); /* border the entire screen */
                                         /* with double graphics line */
