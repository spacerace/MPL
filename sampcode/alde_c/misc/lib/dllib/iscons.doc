                iscons -- is file descriptor the console

        SYNOPSIS
                r = iscons(fd);
                BOOL r;
                FILE *fd;


        DESCRIPTION
        The specified file descriptor (not file handle!) is tested
        to see if it refers to the console device.  TRUE (not 0)
        is returned if it does, and FALSE (0) otherwise.
        This is a test primarily aimed at detecting if stdin or
        stdout have been redirected away from the default console.



        EXAMPLE
                if(iscons(stdin) puts("stdin is the keyboard");
                else ("stdin is probably a file");
