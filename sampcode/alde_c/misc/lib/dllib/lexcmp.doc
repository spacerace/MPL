                lexcmp -- perform comparison on two strings, case independent

        SYNOPSIS
                r = lexcmp(str1, str2);
                BOOL r;
                char str1, str2;


        DESCRIPTION
        This function compares two strings for exactness through each
        string's NULL terminator.  Case is ignored, but the strings must be
        an exact match in all other respects, including length.  Returns
        FALSE (0) if not the same, and TRUE if the same.


        EXAMPLE
             char *str1[] = "FOObar";
             char *str2[] = "fooBAR";
             if(lexcmp(str1, str2)) printf("Strings match\n");
             else printf("Strings do not match\n");

             In this example, the strings match, because upper and
             lower case are considered equal.
