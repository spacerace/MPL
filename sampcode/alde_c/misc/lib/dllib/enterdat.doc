                enterdata -- enter a string of data from keyboard
                disp_enterdata -- same, use direct video access

        SYNOPSIS
                r = enterdata(dest, qty, row, col, mode);
                r = disp_enterdata(dest, qty, row, col, mode);
                int r;          returns TRUE or FALSE
                char *dest;     destination for string
                int qty;        maximum allowable chars + 1
                int row, col;   row and column of string start*
                int mode;       mode for character checking

        DESCRIPTION
        These routines are essentially the same, except that
        disp_enterdata uses the Datalite direct video access
        functions.  enterdata() provides a convenient method
        for entering character strings from the keyboard and
        verifying the character syntax.  Line editing is
        supported to enhance user input.  Entry is as follows:
           Carriage Return terminates input and returns TRUE.
             If no other data was entered, destination string
             is NULLed in the first position. CR is not placed
             into destination.
           ESCape terminates entry at once, NULLs destination,
             clears screen field, and returns FALSE.
           HOME clears field, and restarts entry without returning.
           BACKSPACE and Cursor Left will destructively backspace
             up to beginning of field.
           Only qty - 1 characters will be accepted.
           Any error sounds console BELL.
        Various modes allow for checking of syntax and mapping
        of characters:
           Mode 0:   allow any printable character (ASCII 20H - 7FH)
           Mode 1:   allow only alphabetics (A-Z, a-z)
           Mode 2:   allow alphabetics and numerals only
           Mode 3:   allow numerials only
           Mode 4:   allow hexadecimal characters only (0-9, A-F, a-f)
        Modes 0, 1, and 2 will map lower case to upper case if
        decimal 128 (80H) is OR'd with the mode.



        * for enterfn only: If row = -1, then current cursor position
          will be used, and col value is ignored.

        EXAMPLE

           char string[31];
           unsigned int num;

           d_pos(10, 20, 0);      /* cursor to row 10, column 20 */
           fputs("Enter an alphabetic string: ", stdout);
           if(!enterdata(string, 31, 10, 48, 1)) {
              fputs("\nESCape was pressed");
              }
           else printf("\nString entered is %s\n", string);

           fputs("Enter hex value at current cursor position: ", stdout);
           if(!enterdata(string, 5, -1, 0, 4)) {
              fputs("\nESCape was pressed");
              }
           else {
              num = atoi(string);
              printf("Number entered was %4x", num);
              }
