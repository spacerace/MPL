                blpr -- write a character to LPT? through BIOS 17H
                blprstat -- get LPT? status through BIOS 17H

        SYNOPSIS
                r = blpr(chr, num);
                int r;    returns status in low 8 bits
                char chr; character to write
                int num;  printer number 0-2
                r = blprstat(num);
                int r;    returns status in low 8 bits
                int num;  printer number 0-2


        DESCRIPTION
        These two assembly language routines provide very low-level
        access to the LPT1 - LPT3 drivers in the ROM-BIOS.  Because
        of this dependency upon the ROM-BIOS Interrupt 17H, these
        routines may not work on all compatibles.  The normal DOS
        channel PRN: is bypassed, as is any re-assignment of LPT?.
        Normally, these routines are not used directly; rather, they
        are accessed through the "pr" series subroutine calls.

        Status bits are returned as follows:  (meaning is with bit set)
           bit 0 = time out
           bit 1,2 are unused and should be ignored
           bit 3 = I/O error
           bit 4 = Printer Selected
           bit 5 = Out of Paper
           bit 6 = Acknowledged
           bit 7 = Not Busy


        EXAMPLE

           int i;
           i = blprstat(0);     /* LPT1: is 0 */
           if(!(i & 0x80)) puts("Printer is busy");
           else blpr('A', 0);
