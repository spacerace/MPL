        SYNOPSIS
                void exit2dos();


        DESCRIPTION
        When invoked, this function clears the screen and places
        the message "Exit to DOS?" in the center of the display.
        The keyboard is read, and if the response is 'Y' or 'y',
        an aabort(0) function is called.  For any other response,
        the function simply returns to the users program, which
        must then do whatever is necessary to continue with the
        program.
