               repchar -- repeat a character n times to fd

       SYNOPSIS
               void repchar(chr, qty, fd);
               char chr;       character to send
               int qty;        number of characters to send
               FILE *fd;       file descriptor of output channel

       DESCRIPTION
       This function sends qty number of chr to fd, which is usually
       stdout, stderr, or an open file.  Maximum qty is 128.
       If qty > 128, it will be truncated to 128.  This limit is due
       to an internal string buffer.  For speed, the string is filled
       and then fputs() is called to output the data as a string.

       EXAMPLE

             repchar('X', 50, stdout);

       to output a double horizontal line:
             #include "graphics.h"
             repchar(DHLINE, 50, stdout);
