                i_dstr -- make an integer from a decimal ascii string

        SYNOPSIS
                c = i_dstr(p, r);
                char *p;       destination string pointer
                int r;         integer to convert
                int c;         count of characters in string


        DESCRIPTION
        Convert an integer into an ascii decimal string (unsigned).
        Range is that of 16 bits unsigned, or 0-65535.  The function
        returns the number of characters placed in the string.  The string
        is NULL terminated, and must be at least six bytes long to
        accomodate the longest number plus the NULL.  Numbers are assumed
        to be positive.


        EXAMPLE

               char string[6];
               int count;
               count = i_dstr(string, 1357);
                 count will equal 4
                 string will be "1357\0"
