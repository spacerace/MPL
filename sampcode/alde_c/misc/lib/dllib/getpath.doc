                getpath -- retrieve the PATH variable and parse

        SYNOPSIS
                c = getpath(string);
                int c;          count of characters returned in string
                char *string[]; destination for parsed string. Minimum 128
                                bytes, but longer paths could clobber this.

        DESCRIPTION
        This function extracts the PATH variable (if it exists) and makes
        a "pseudo-array" at destination string.  All semi-colon separators
        are replaced by NULL bytes.  The returned integer count totals
        all characters inserted into the string including NULLS, and
        should be used to determine the exact end of the string, since
        a NULL byte will not determine this.

        EXAMPLE
                char *string[135];
                int count;
                count = getpath(string);

         count will return as zero if no PATH is found.
