                basename -- split a string into path and/or filename

        SYNOPSIS
                function(s1, s2, s3);
                char *s1;      original string
                char *s2;      destination for path portion
                char *s3;      destination for name portion

        DESCRIPTION
        This function will split a potential filename specification into
        the subdirectory path and the filename itself.  The split
        is made at the final '\' character.  If none exists, s3 will
        be the same as s1, and s2[0] will be NULL.  If only a path
        exists, s2 equals s1, and s3[0] is NULL.

        EXAMPLE
             char *name[] = "C:\looney\bin\wumpus.com";
             char path[32], file[16];
             basename(name, path, file);

             after execution, arrays are as follows (NULL terminated):
                *name (unchanged)
                *path C:\looney\bin\
                *file wumpus.com
