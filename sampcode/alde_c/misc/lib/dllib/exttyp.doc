                exttyp -- check a filename for a particular extension

        SYNOPSIS
                r = exttyp(filename, extn);
                BOOL r;         returns TRUE if match, else FALSE
                char *filename  filename to test
                char *extn      extension string for match

        DESCRIPTION
        This function makes no changes to either entry parameter,
        but simply returns TRUE if the specified extension is found in
        the filename, or FALSE (0) if it is not.  Case of the characters is
        ignored.  The function is most useful to insure that a particular
        program will only use an extension of a specified type.

        EXAMPLE
             (assume argv[1] is string "foobar.com")

             if(exttyp(argv[1], "COM")) printf("File is executable");
             else printf("File is not executable");
