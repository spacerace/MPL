                ibmtype -- find out type of computer

        SYNOPSIS
                r = ibmtype();
                int r;   r = 0 for PC or XT, 1 for PC Jr.,
                         2 for AT, 3 for unknown type


        DESCRIPTION
        This function examines the byte in ROM at F000:FFFEh.
        For real IBM computers, this should be:
           0xff  PC
           0xfe  XT
           0xfd  JR
           0xfc  AT
        Many close clones will also encode this byte in the above manner,
        although there is no requirement for this feature.

        CAVEAT
        The results of this test should be taken with a grain of salt
        the size of Salt Lake City.  Even IBM has shipped XTs with
        the PC id byte.  The NOVAS AT clone correctly has 0xfc,
        but the Z-NIX XT clone (which is a very close clone) has 0x05.
        Don't depend too heavily on the results being really accurate.

        EXAMPLE
                 r = ibmtype();
                 if(r = 2) printf("This machine is an AT, maybe!");
