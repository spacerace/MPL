                pr_nl -- print a carriage return/line feed to printer
                pr_puts -- print a string to the printer
                pr_putline -- print a string, and a cr/lf to the printer
                pr_eject -- send a formfeed to the printer
                pr_carret -- send a carriage return to the printer
                pr_set -- set the number of the current printer
                pr_putc -- send a character to the printer

        SYNOPSIS
               all routines except pr_putc are type void
               unless noted, no parameters are needed:
               pr_putline(str);  char *str;
               pr_puts(str);     char *str;
               pr_set(num);      int num 0, 1, or 2
               r = pr_putc(ch);  char ch;  int r; (returned status)


        DESCRIPTION
        This series of routines use the low level functions
        blpr() and blprstat() to access the LPT? ROM-BIOS drivers
        directly.  pr_putc() returns the same status that is returned
        by blprstat().  Be sure to use pr_set() to set which LPT is
        to be accessed.  Note that the library defaults to LPT1:,
        and pr_set() may be ignored if that printer is to be used.


        EXAMPLE

           pr_set(LP1);        /* LP1, LP2, LP3 defined in smdefs.h */
           pr_putline("Hello World");
           pr_eject();
