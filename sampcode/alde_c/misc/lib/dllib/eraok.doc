                eraok -- ask permission before overwriting existing file

        SYNOPSIS
                eraok(filename);
                char *filename  filename to test

        DESCRIPTION
        This function checks for the existance of the specified filename
        and if it exists, will ask the user (through stderr) if the file
        can be lost.  If the user responds Y or y, the file is lost and
        return is made to the caller.  If the response is anything else,
        the program aborts immediately, and the routine does NOT return
        to the caller.  Exit is via the aabort() function of this library.

        EXAMPLE
             (assume argv[1] is string "foobar.com")

             eraok(argv[1]);
             printf("File %s has been deleted", argv[1]);
