               mktone -- make a tone to the speaker

       SYNOPSIS
               #include "sound.h"
               void mktone(freq, update, delay);
               int freq;       frequency of tone
               int update      speaker control command
               int delay       value to delay before returning

       DESCRIPTION
       This is a very simple function to make a tone on the IBM speaker
       using the standard timer controller.  The frequency is an integer
       which increases the pitch of the tone with decreasing values.
       the delay is an integer which is used in a very simple "for" loop
       to control duration of the tone.  A value of 0 is no delay.
       The update integer is defined in sound.h as follows:
              if update == UPDATE  just send frequency and delay
              if update == TOGGLE  turn sound off after delay is complete
              else  turn sound on and leave it on when returning
       Any tone may be turned off by setting freq to 0.  In this case,
       update and delay values are ignored and may be set to any value.

       EXAMPLE
             #include "sound.h"
             mktone(1000, TOGGLE, 1000);  /* make a short beep */

             mktone(1000, ON, 0);         /* turn a tone on */
             mktone(0, 0, 0);             /* turn a tone off */

             mktone(2000, ON, 0);         /* turn a tone on */
             mktone(1000, UPDATE, 0);     /* raise the pitch */
             mktone(0, 0, 0);             /* turn it off */


       This function is found in SMDLx.LIB for the Datalight Compiler.
