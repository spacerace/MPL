                onexit -- install a common exit routine

        SYNOPSIS
                onexit(addr);
                int *addr;      address of function to call



        DESCRIPTION
        This function is used to install a function into the
        common_exit routine.  It may be used to provide a means
        of insuring that one or more operations are performed before
        a program exit.  Note that the installed routine is ONLY
        called if common_exit() is called to invoke it.  Doing
        a standard exit() will NOT call the installed routine.


        EXAMPLE

             void exithandler() {
                  removetick();
                  }                /* insure ticker is removed */

             main() {
                   onexit(&exithandler);
                          ..
                          ..
                          ..
                    common_exit();
                    }

        N.B.:
            Any function in this Library which does an exit will
            call common_exit.   This includes (but may not be limited to):
                error()      aabort()       badext()
                eraok()      exit2dos()     cant()





        This function is found in SMDLx.LIB for the Datalight Compiler.
