                argval -- convert an ASCII numerical string from an argument

        SYNOPSIS
                i = argval(string, dest, i);
                int i;         index into the current argument string
                               which is returned incremented to the
                               first character after the numerical string
                char *string;  the string containing the numerical value
                int dest;      destination for resultant integer value


        DESCRIPTION
        This function is primarily intended to parse command line arguments
        containing numerical values into an integer.  The function will
        abort the program if the index points to a non-numeric digit
        upon entry with an error message and the option character which
        preceeds the index pointer.
        Numeric values cannot exceed four characters without causing
        potential damage to the program by overrunning the character
        storage area.

        EXAMPLE
                assume argv[1] = "-M30C"

                int i, value;
                i = 2    /* i is incremented to '3' by other code */
                i = argval(&argv[1], value, i);

                after execution, i = 4 (pointing to 'C')
                                 value = 30
                                 argv[1] is unchanged



       This function is found in SMDLx.LIB for the Datalight Compiler.
