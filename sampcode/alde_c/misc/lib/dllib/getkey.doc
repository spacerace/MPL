               getkey -- extended keyboard fetch

       SYNOPSIS
               #include "keys.h"
               r = getkey();
               int r;          returns keyboard value


       DESCRIPTION
       This function eases the reading of all keys, whether normal
       or function keys.  The getch() function is used to return a keyboard
       value.  If the first value received is 0, then a second value
       is fetched and 256 (0x100) is added to flag the return value
       as an extended function key.  The calling program should check
       for a return value greater than 256.  If true, subtract 256 and
       consider the result as a function key.  Most function keys
       are defined in tools.h, and others may be user added.

       EXAMPLE
             This example tests for function key 3 (FK3)

             #include "tools.h"
             int r;

             while(TRUE) {
                r = getkey();
                if(r < 256) {
                   printf("Not FK3 key");
                   continue;
                   }
                else r -= 256;
                if(r == FK3) printf("FK3 sensed!!!");
                }
