               fillch -- fill a string with a character

       SYNOPSIS
               void fillch(dest, chr, qty);
               char *dest      destination string
               char chr        character to place
               int qty         number to place

       DESCRIPTION
       This function fills string "dest" with "qty" number of characters
       "chr".  The destination string must be large enough to hold the
       indicated quantity, as no check is made. In addition, a NULL
       is not placed after the last character.

       EXAMPLE
               char string[20];
               fillch(string, 'A', 19);
               string[20] = NULL;

        makes a usable string of 19 "A" characters.
