                common_exit -- terminate a program

        SYNOPSIS
                common_exit(code);
                int code;     exit error code


        DESCRIPTION
        The program is terminated with the standard exit() function using
        the specified code.  The advantage of using this function is that
        the installable exit handler "exeunt()" is called before exit().





        EXAMPLE

                common_exit(0);



        SEE ALSO:
                onexit() function to install a common exit routine.
