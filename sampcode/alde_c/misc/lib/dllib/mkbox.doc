       graphics characters on the "page" specified.  The "startr"
       and "startc" parameters anchor the upper left corner.  The
       "ht" and "width" set the dimensions.  No checks are made for
       valid numbers.  Function has been used with both CGA and Mono
       cards, but has not been tested with EGA cards as yet.
