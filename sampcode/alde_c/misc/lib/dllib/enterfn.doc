                enterfn -- enter a filename from keyboard
                disp_enterfn -- same, use direct video access

        SYNOPSIS
                void enterdata(dest, qty, row, col, allow);
                void disp_enterdata(dest, qty, row, col, allow);
                char *dest;     destination for string
                int qty;        maximum allowable chars + 1
                int row, col;   row and column of string start*
                int allow;      TRUE to allow entension entry

        DESCRIPTION
        These routines are essentially the same, except that
        disp_enterfn uses the Datalite direct video access
        functions.  enterfn() provides a convenient method
        for entering a path and filename from the keyboard and
        verifying the character syntax.  Line editing is
        supported to enhance user input.  Entry is as follows:
           Carriage Return terminates input.
             If no other data was entered, destination string
             is NULLed in the first position. CR is not placed
             into destination.
           ESCape terminates entry at once, NULLs destination,
             and clears screen field.
           HOME clears field, and restarts entry without returning.
           BACKSPACE and Cursor Left will destructively backspace
             up to beginning of field.
           Only qty - 1 characters will be accepted.
           Any error sounds console BELL.
           If "allow" is TRUE, then a filename extension may be
             entered.  Otherwise, no extension may be entered, since
             the period character will be disallowed.
           A drive may be specified; the colon is only allowed in the
             second character string position.


        EXAMPLE

           char string[31];

           d_pos(10, 20, 0);      /* cursor to row 10, column 20 */
           fputs("Enter a filename: ", stdout);
           enterfn(string, 31, 10, 38, TRUE));

           fputs("Enter filename at current cursor position: ", stdout);
           enterdata(string, 31, -1, 0, FALSE);

        * for enterfn only: If row = -1, then current cursor position
          will be used, and col value is ignored.
