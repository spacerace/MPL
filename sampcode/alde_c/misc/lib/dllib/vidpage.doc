                vidpage -- set a video page as active page

        SYNOPSIS
                void vidpage(page);
                int page;      0-7 depending upon mode


        DESCRIPTION
        This function sets the video display page to any page 0-7
        subject to the effective video mode.  Note that the 
        monochrome card does not support video pages and therefore
        this function will have no effect.



        EXAMPLE

             vidpage(0);    default lowest page
