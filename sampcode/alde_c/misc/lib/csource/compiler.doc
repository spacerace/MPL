Coronado Enterprises Turbo C TUTOR (ver 1.50)      Feb 1, 1988

COMPILER.DOC file

This tutorial is written specifically for the Turbo-C compiler
by Borland International.  It is written for the first release
of that particular compiler, and many of the topics discussed
refer to the User's Guide and Reference Guide for that particular
release.  For that reason, when Borland releases a new version,
some of the page numbers may be in error for the new release, but
the topics will still be useable and valid.  It is written to
teach you how to read and write Turbo C programs but even more
important, it is intended to teach you the vocabulary of the C
language so that you can intelligently read the literature about C.

Due to the ease of use of the Integrated Environment version of
Turbo C, It will be used exclusively by this tutorial.  You can
use the Command Line version of Turbo C with this tutorial, but
all notes in the tutorial will describe use of the Integrated
Environment version.



******** Note - Note - Note - Note - Note - Note - Note *********

All of the files in the Coronado Enterprises Turbo C tutorial are
designed to work with the Turbo C compiler with all options left
in the default mode (ie - the way the compiler comes from the
factory), and any changes may affect the way some of the example
programs work.  For example, if you were to change the number of
significant characters used for an identifier to 4, the program
named SCOPE.C in chapter 5, would have all 3 functions named the
same, namely "head", and the program would not work.  You would
actually have other problems with this change, but they will not
be commented on here.  Other kinds of errors are also possible, so
it would be best that you simply use the Borland defaults for the
duration of the tutorial and when you have gained experience with
C, customize your compiler to suit your own taste.




****************** Suggested Hard Disk Setup *********************
The Turbo C User's Guide has complete instructions describing
how to set up your system for proper use.  Following the direc-
tions given will result in the following directory setup if you
are using a hard disk.  Some of the files have been omitted in
this suggested setup to reduce the clutter in the TURBOC directory.
This will reduce the confusion over extra files as you work your
way through the tutorials.

Note that there are slight differences in using version 1.0 and
1.5 of TURBO C.  The differences will be pointed out in the follow-
ing descriptions of setup and use.

      ********* TURBO C version 1.0 **********
   TURBO C disk 1 - Integrated Development Env.
   TURBO C disk 2 - Command Line/Utilities
   TURBO C disk 3 - Header Files/Libraries/Examples
   TURBO C disk 4 - Libraries/Examples

      ********* TURBO C version 1.5 **********
   TURBO C disk 1 - Integrated Development Env.
   TURBO C disk 2 - Command Line/Utilities
   TURBO C disk 3 - Header Files/Libraries
   TURBO C disk 4 - Libraries
   TURBO C disk 5 - Examples


C:\TURBOC\
    TC.EXE                  /* From Turbo C disk 1              */
    TCCONFIG.TC             /* You make this file - See below   */
    TCHELP.TCH              /* From Turbo C disk 1 (ver 1.0)    */
    TCHELP.TCH              /* From Turbo C disk 5 (ver 1.5)    */
    *.*                     /* From Turbo C Tutor SOURCE disk   */

C:\TURBOC\INCLUDE\
    *.H                     /* From Turbo C disk 3              */

C:\TURBOC\INCLUDE\SYS\
    STAT.H                  /* From Turbo C disk 3 \SYS\ subdir.*/

C:\TURBOC\LIB\
    *.OBJ                   /* From Turbo C disk 3              */
    *.LIB                   /* From Turbo C disk 3              */
    *.OBJ                   /* From Turbo C disk 4 - optional   */
    *.LIB                   /* From Turbo C disk 4 - optional   */

The *.OBJ and *.LIB files from disk 4 are needed only if you wish
to use additional memory models.  You only need the "Small" memory
model to run all of the programs included in the Coronado Enter-
prises Turbo C tutorial.

After creating the subdirectories listed above and loading them
with the files listed, change to the TURBOC directory and create
the TCCONFIG.TC file by following these instructions (note that
the instructions are given on page 16 of the Turbo C User's guide
but they are somewhat cryptic for the beginner).

1.   TC<return>                  This loads the TURBO-C compiler
2.   O                           Selects "Options"
3.   E   (version 1.0)           Selects "Environment"
3.   D   (version 1.5)           Selects "Directories"
4.   I                           Selects "Include directories"
5.   \TURBOC\INCLUDE<return>     Sets directory for include files
6.   L                           Selects "Library directory"
7.   \TURBOC\LIB<return>         Sets directory for library files
8.   <Esc>                       Returns to "Options" menu
9.   S                           Selects "Store options"
10.  <return>                    Stores file named "TCCONFIG.TC"
11.  <Esc>                       Return to the TURBO-C main menu




To run your first program.  (This assumes FIRSTEX.C has been copied
into the \TURBOC\ directory from the tutorial SOURCE disk.)

1.   TC<return>                  Loads the Turbo C compiler
2.   F                           Selects "Files"
3.   L                           Selects "Load"
4.   <return>                    Lists all files *.C
5.   Position cursor on FIRSTEX.C
6.   <return>                    Loads FIRSTEX.C
7.   Alt-R                       Compiles and runs FIRSTEX





**************** Suggested Dual Floppy Disk Setup *****************

The Turbo C User's Guide has very sketchy information on how to set
up the system for use from two floppies so the following information
is given to get you started.  As you gain experience with the C lan-
guage, you can add features and move files around to make it more
convenient to use.  The setup given here will result in the source
files and executable files residing on drive B.  You will develop a
more convenient system soon, but this setup will get you started.
You will find that you will have to stop often and erase the *.OBJ
and the *.EXE files that are generated by Turbo C or your disk will
fill up with these extra files.

Format a disk with the system on it (ie - FORMAT A:/S) and put the
following files on it for your drive A disk.

    TC.EXE                  /* From Turbo C disk 1              */
    TCCONFIG.TC             /* You make this file - see below   */
    TCHELP.TCH              /* From Turbo C disk 1 (ver 1.0)    */
    TCHELP.TCH              /* From Turbo C disk 5 (ver 1.5)    */
                            /* Note - You will probably have    */
                            /* room for an AUTOEXEC.BAT file on */
                            /* this disk also.                  */


Format a disk without the system, make the following directories
on it, and add the following files to it in their respective dir-
ectories. This will be the disk for drive B.  You will put a few
of the source files from the Coronado Enterprises tutorial on this
disk in the root directory.

\
    *.C                     /* From the Turbo C Tutor SOURCE disk */

\INCLUDE\
    *.H                     /* From Turbo C disk 3                */

\INCLUDE\SYS\
    STAT.H                  /* From Turbo C disk 3                */

\LIB\
    COS.OBJ                 /* From Turbo C disk 3                */
    CS.LIB                  /* From Turbo C disk 3                */
    EMU.LIB                 /* From Turbo C disk 3                */
    FP87.LIB                /* From Turbo C disk 3                */
    MATHS.LIB               /* From Turbo C disk 3                */


After creating the disks as listed above, install the disks in
drive A and drive B and boot up the computer on drive A.  You
must then create the TCCONFIG.TC file by following these instruc-
tions (note that the instructions are given on page 14 of the Turbo
C User's guide but they are somewhat cryptic for the beginner).


1.   TC<return>                  This loads the TURBO-C compiler
2.   O                           Selects "Options"
3.   E  (version 1.0)            Selects "Environment"
3.   D  (version 1.5)            Selects "Directories"
4.   I                           Selects "Include directories"
5.   B:\INCLUDE<return>          Sets directory for include files
6.   O                           Selects "Output directory"
7.   B:\<return>                 Sets directory for output files
8.   L                           Selects "Library directory"
9.   B:\LIB<return>              Sets directory for library files
10.  <Esc>                       Returns to "Options" menu
11.  S                           Selects "Store options"
12.  <return>                    Stores file named "TCCONFIG.TC"
13.  <Esc>                       Return to the TURBO-C main menu
14.  F                           Selects the "File" menu
15.  L                           Selects the "Load" submenu
16.  B:*.C<return>               Selects the B drive for files
17.  <Esc>                       Return to the "File" menu
18.  <Esc>                       Return to the TURBO-C main menu

Note that steps 14 through 16 must be performed once each time the
Turbo C system is started to tell the system where to find the
working files.

To run your first program.  (This assumes FIRSTEX.C has been copied
into the root directory from the tutorial SOURCE disk.)  Load the
two disks into the computer and boot up the system.

1.   TC<return>                  Loads the Turbo C compiler
2.   F                           Selects "Files"
3.   L                           Selects "Load"
4.   B:*.C<return>               Lists all files *.C
5.   Position cursor on FIRSTEX.C
6.   <return>                    Loads FIRSTEX.C
7.   Alt-R                       Compiles and runs FIRSTEX




**************** Suggested Single Floppy Disk Setup ****************

In order to use the Turbo C compiler with a single floppy disk,
set up two disks as noted for the Dual Floppy Disk system.  Use the
disk designated for drive A above to boot up the computer and perform
steps 1 through 13 given above, leaving off the drive designation for
drive B in steps 5, 7, 9, and 16.

To run the system, use the disk designated for drive A for booting
and loading the TC system, then install the other disk as the work-
ing disk.  You will have all of the capabilities of the dual drive
system except for the "HELP" facility and the ability to run an oper-
ating system shell from within the Turbo C Integrated environment.
