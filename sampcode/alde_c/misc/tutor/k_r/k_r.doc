This disk contains demostration programs that parallel the Kernighan and
Ritchie book: The C Programming Language.  The programs are grouped by
chapter (C-CH.1 thru C-CH.7). Each chapter contains various examples or
C programs that demostrate a function or method.  These programs are not
meant to be finished C programs, rather they were created for classroom
use as an aide.  Most of these programs are in general C libraries although
generally in a greatly enhanced form.

One warning.
These programs were created on a UNIX system, an AT&T 3B20s and a
Digital VAX 11/70.  Keep this in mind while using the files.

The file 'C-FUNCT', is a collection of more usable function calls that
may be used and called within a C program.

The file 'C-PRG.LS', is the complete listing of programs included on this
disk.  For information, the listing is the output from the UNIX version
of the DOS 'dir' command.  The first column, mostly -rw-r--r-- is the file
permissions.  The first (-) is the directory place, the letter 'd', denotes
that this entry is a directory, the hyphen, denotes that the entry is a file.
The next 3 positions (rw-), show the permissions for the owner of the file.
Read and Write permissions are in force here.  The hyphen in the 3rd position
denotes that the 'execute' permission is not in force.  In the last 6
positions, the first 3 are for the group permissions and the last 3 are for
the public permissions.  In this example, the group and public have only
read permissions.  The next three columns, mostly (1 cp18     cp), indicate
quanity of links and owners (cp18 is the login).  The rest is roughly
the same as 'dir'.
