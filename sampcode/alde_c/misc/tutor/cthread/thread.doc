Abstract

     Thread is a C language help utility.  It was written by a member of
     the U.S.D.A. Grad School faculty to help students learning the C
     language.  Thread is a variable record-length database, together
     with an index, that enables fast look up and display of C keywords,
     standard library functions, and other items.

Usage summary

     Operation of thread is self explanatory.

     -  Simply enter "thread" at the DOS level.
     -  When the menu screen appears, type in the keyword,
           operator, or function desired as shown on the menu.
           Only the first 5 characters are required, but you
           may enter the complete entry if you choose.
     -  If you make a typing error, the item will not be found
           in the search list, and the menu screen will redisplay.
           To correct an error, you may use the function keys
           as in DOS.

     For faster reference, you may also use command line arguments at
     the DOS level to look up entries.


Features

     Thread contains two features that are unusual in a help facility.

 (1) Thread will accept lookup items from the command line. That is,
     enter:
                         thread precedence

     on the command line, and you'll receive a quick screenful of the C
     language precedence table.

     Thread will accept more than one item on the command line, and look
     up each in sequence.  In other words, enter:

                thread char short int long float double

     and thread will provide a quick survey of C's variable storage
     types. The multiple command line argument feature can be used to
     dissect a line of C code into its major components.  For example,
     enter the line

                    thread while (fahr <= upper) {

     and thread will show screens of information about the "while"
     keyword, and the the "<=" operator.  The other items will not be
     found in the help file and will be passed over.

     Be sure to use a space between keywords and operators if using this
     option.  Thread will not find matches in the line

                    thread printf("\nitem",name);

     because it will treat the item as a single word argument. (Maybe a
     future version....)


 (2) At any time, when the help screen is shown, it's possible the help
     item may contain a "thread".  A thread is a related keyword or
     concept that may help clarify the meaning of the current search
     item.

     When an item contains a thread, the continuation message at the
     bottom of the screen will read:

        Press space to continue, T to follow thread, Esc to quit

     Press the 't' key, (upper or lower case accepted), and thread will
     search for the related item immediately and display its help
     screen.

     The thread option will not terminate the command line argument
     sequence.  The processing of command line items will resume when
     when you choose to stop threading, or when there are no further
     thread items to follow.


DOS redirection characters

     Since DOS intercepts the characters '|', '<' and '>' for purposes
     of redirecting files, some special handling of these characters had
     to be added.  If the string you are seeking contains one of these
     special characters and you wish to enter it from the command line,
     place double quotes around the argument.  That is:

                        thread ">>" void "|"

     would look up the >> operator, the word void, and then the |
     operator. No quotes are necessary when using lookup from the main
     menu.


Processing search items

     When you enter a search item at the menu prompt, thread strips all
     blanks from your response.  Entries of:   char,char  , and c h a r
     are all equivalent.

     If you make a typing error entering a search item, you can use the
     function keys F1, F2, and F3 together with the backspace, insert,
     and delete keys as in standard DOS command editing.



Exiting thread

     After presenting the help screen, thread will prompt for a carriage
     return to return to the menu, possibly a thread item, or the Esc
     key.  Entering  a carriage return will return the user to the main
     menu.   Entering escape will exit the program immediately, and
     leave the help screen on the user's screen.   If you use a editor
     like Sidekick's note facility, you can then see both the upper part
     of the help screen and your own work file.  Seeing the correct
     syntax along with the file you're working on may be useful.

     Thread may also be exited by entering a carriage return at the main
     menu prompt.

     A Ctrl-Brk at any time will also terminate thread.


Installation

     The easiest way to operate thread is simply to place the three
     files THREAD.EXE, THREAD.DAT, and THREAD.NDX in your current
     working directory.  A good choice for the location of THREAD might
     be the directory that contains your C compiler or interpreter.

     THREAD can also be installed on your system so that it can be
     invoked from any current working directory.  To do so, place
     THREAD.EXE in a directory included in your DOS path, or
     change your path to pass through the directory that holds
     THREAD.EXE.

     In addition, you need to create a DOS environment variable to
     indicate the directory location of the files THREAD.DAT and
     THREAD.NDX.  To do so, use the DOS SET command to establish a
     variable called THREAD that gives the fully qualified directory
     name of the directory where you have placed THREAD.DAT and
     THREAD.NDX files.

     For example, if you had placed all 3 of the THREAD files on a hard
     disk identified as drive C: in a directory named C_HELP, you should
     enter the DOS command:

                        SET THREAD=C:\C_HELP

     and make sure that your current path includes the C_HELP
     directory.  For example, one path meeting this requirement would
     be:

                    PATH=C:\BIN;C:\C3;C:\C_HELP

     Another example, for those with ample memory space, is to place the
     files THREAD.DAT and THREAD.NDX on a RAM drive, and to include the
     THREAD.EXE file somewhere in the current path.  The program works
     very quickly in this configuration.  If THREAD.EXE were located in
     C:\BIN, and the DAT and NDX files on a RAM drive identified as D:,
     a sample setup might be:

                    PATH=C:\;C:\C3;C:\BIN
                    SET THREAD=D:

     The program checks the environment for the THREAD variable before
     it looks in the current working directory.  Thus, if you use the
     SET THREAD option, it will have to be correct, even if the files
     are subsequently moved into the same working directory.  To disable
     the THREAD variable, enter the command

                    SET THREAD=

     at the DOS level, which will erase the value from the DOS
     environment.

     If you use THREAD frequently, you can add the SET and PATH commands
     to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Since the program THREAD.EXE is not
     itself memory resident, it will not conflict with any memory
     resident programs you use.  The order of placement of the SET
     THREAD command within the autoexec file is of no importance.

     If you wish, you can rename the .EXE file to a shorter name, or one
     that you find more appropriate.  However, the .DAT and .NDX
     filenames and the environment variable THREAD are hard-coded and
     should not be renamed.


C_COURSE.BAT

     A file named C_COURSE.bat is included with the package.  It is a
     DOS batch file which repeatedly executes thread, with items laid
     out in the order they might be presented in a typical C course.
     The easiest way to use C_COURSE is to continually press the return
     key to step through the entire listing.  The batch file can provide
     a quick summary of C.


Resist the urge to rewrite the help file

     The help file is accessed via the thread.ndx file, which contains
     the offset of the search item in the thread.dat text file.  If you
     are dissatisfied with any of the explanations or examples given in
     the help screens, you may feel a need to access the thread.dat file
     and edit the offending screen.  Please don't.  Any change in the
     thread.dat file will invalidate the thread.ndx file and cause the
     program to search through inappropriate locations in the text file.

Acknowledgements

     Thread was compiled using Microsoft C, version 3.0.

     Thread originated as a homework assignment for adults in USDA's C
     Programming class, ECOMP 275 in the Fall of 1985.  Students were
     asked to write up descriptive screens for individually assigned
     keywords, operators, and functions.  I am grateful to those
     students who participated in the exercise by completing some form
     of usable description.  Those screens formed the core around which
     the program was designed.  In the course of a year, however, every
     screen has been substancially edited or compeletely rewritten, so
     that any resemblance to the originals are purely coincidental.

     An assembly screen writing routine was used to speed up screen
     displays.  The original routine was the product of Brian Foley,
     David B. Rein, and Michael D. Most.  The version used here is a
     modified routine which changes end-of-line processing for both
     color and monochrome monitors.

     The idea for the index creation routine was suggested by a package
     provided by Philip Mongelluzzo, named BOSS0508.ARC.  The program
     used in connection with this package was a modification of the
     index program presented there. The index generation routine is not
     included with the THREAD package.

     I'm grateful to Pete Olympia and Bob Blacher for their reviews and
     comments on a pre-release version of THREAD.

     The "K & R" reference at the top right of the display screen refer
     to the book: The C Programming Language, by Brian W. Kernighan and
     Dennis M Ritchie, Prentice Hall Software Series, 1978.  No
     connection with or approval by these authors is implied by the
     reference.  It is included solely for those wishing to find more
     details about a particular concept.

     While this program was written for the use by students in USDA
     class ECOMP 275, no approval or authorization by the USDA Grad
     School is implied by this connection.  The author takes sole
