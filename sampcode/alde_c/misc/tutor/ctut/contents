 A NOTE ABOUT THE LESSONS in C 
.x4-24R5C4
These were written while the author was ~Ilearning~N  the language and since
.R6C4
they  are  ~Ifree~N ( to  copy  and/or  distribute ) there  is  a money-back
.R7C4
guarantee on the accuracy of each and every statement in the lessons (!)
.R9C4
The  ~Idisplay~N  program was written ( in C ) in order to provide a vehicle
.R10C4
for displaying the lessons.
