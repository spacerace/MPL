These were written while the author was ~Ilearning~N  the language and since
.R6C4
they  are  ~Ifree~N ( to  copy  and/or  distribute ) there  is  a money-back
.R7C4
guarantee on the accuracy of each and every statement in the lessons (!)
.R9C4
The  ~Idisplay~N  program was written ( in C ) in order to provide a vehicle

    When we begin our C program with ~b~Imain()~N we are defining a
    ~Ifunction~N. Execution of our C program will ~Ibegin~N at the 
    statements which make up this function (and it is this property
    which makes the name ~b~Imain~N special).

    Here we define three ~b~Ifloat~N variables called ~b~Ix~N, ~b~Iy~N and 
    ~b~Ia~N and ~b~Iprintf~N instructions asking for ~b~Ix~N and ~b~Iy~N.
    Note that the user must enter a ~Ispace~N to separate the two numbers.
    (Pressing the ~Itab~N key between numbers will also 'separate' them).
    ~b~Iprintf()~N is a function, just like ~b~Imain()~N. When we invoke
    this function we pass to it a ~Iformat~N string (between quotes) and
    (sometimes) a list of variables to be printed. In this example there
    is ~Ionly~N the ~Iformat string~N (which prints a ~b~In~Newline first):

           ~V"\n Enter two numbers (separated by a space) : "~N

.R12C1
    Now we use the ~Ifunction~N ~b~Iscanf()~N to input the two numbers    
    ~b~Ix~N and ~b~Iy~N. Note that ~b~Iscanf()~N also requires a ~Iformat~N  
    string (namely ~b~I"%f%f"~N) and a variable list ~b~Ix,y~N.

    Here we see another ~Ifunction~N called ~b~Iaverage()~N. We pass to this
    function the values of two variables, ~b~Ix~N and ~b~Iy~N.

    The C language recognizes a ~Ifunction~N by the fact that it is given
    a name (like ~b~Imain~N, ~b~Iscanf~N, ~b~Iprintf~N or ~b~Iaverage~N)
    followed ~Iimmediately~N by parentheses ~b~I(....)~N. Within the ~b~I(~N
    and the ~b~I)~N is information which is passed to the ~Ifunction~N.
    Unlike ~b~Iscanf()~N and ~b~Iprintf()~N (which are included in the C
    library of functions and are available for our use), the function
    which we are calling ~b~Iaverage()~N is one which we must write ourself!
.W
.N
~b~Imain() {~
~b~Ifloat x,y,a;~N
~b~Iprintf("\n Enter two numbers (separated by a space) : ");~N
~b~Iscanf("%f%f",&x,&y);~N        (note that we've changed to ~b~I&x,&y~N)
~Va=average(x,y);~N
~Vprintf("\n The average of %f and %f is %f",x,y,a);~N
~b~I}~N
    The functions ~b~Iscanf()~N and ~b~Iprintf()~N perform their task and
    ~Ireturn~N nothing, but our ~Ifunction~N ~b~Iaverage()~N is expected to
    ~Ireturn the average~N of the two variable values we passed to it.

    In our program above we assign this 'returned average' to the ~b~Ifloat~N
    variable we are calling ~b~Ia~N....and pass to ~b~Iprintf()~N a ~Iformat~N
    string ~b~I"\n The average of %f and %f is %f"~N indicating that we want
    certain text printed (after a ~b~In~Newline) as well as 3 ~b~I%f~Nloat
    numbers.
.w

    The variable list which we pass to ~b~Iprintf()~N (namely ~b~Ix,y,a~N)
    tells ~b~Iprintf()~N which 3 ~b~I%f~Nloat values are to replace the 3
    ~b~I%f~N which occur in the 'format' information.

   writing the function average()    

    Like the function ~b~Imain()~N, we begin with the name and an opening
    ~b~I{~N. BUT, unlike ~b~Imain()~N, the function ~b~Iaverage~N is to
    ~Ireceive~N two variables....so, ~Ibefore our opening {~N, we write:

~b~Iaverage(x,y)~N
~b~Ifloat x,y;~N
~b~I{~N                      the opening ~b~I{~N occurs ~Iafter~N the
                             declaration ~b~Ifloat x,y~N !

         ~V                                                       ~N
         ~V THE FIRST STATEMENT IN A FUNCTION  even before the {  ~N
         ~V MUST BE A DECLARATION OF THE ARGUMENT TYPES!          ~N
         ~V                                                       ~N

    ...let's continue writing our ~Iaverage()~N function:
.K19,60
GO!GO!GO!
.WN
~b~Iaverage(x,y)~N
~b~Ifloat x,y;~N
~b~I{~N  
~Vfloat z;~N
~b~Iz=(x+y)/2;~N
~b~Ireturn(z);~N
~b~I}~N

    The ~Vfloat z;~N (within the body of our function) declares the
    variable ~Vz~N to be a ~Vfloat~N.
.W
.R4C1
~b~Ifloat z;~N
~Vz=(x+y)/2;~N
.R12C1
    ~Vz=(x+y)/2~N assigns to ~Vz~N the average of ~Vx~N and ~Vy~N.
.W
.R5C1
~b~Iz=(x+y)/2;~N
~Vreturn(z);~N
.R14C1
    ~Vreturn(z);~N will ~Ireturn~N the value of ~Vz~N (so it can be
    used in our ~b~Imain()~N program.
.WN
    The whole thing, including ~b~Imain()~N, is now:
~b~Imain() {~N
~b~Ifloat x,y,a;~N
~b~Iprintf("\n Enter two numbers (separated by a space) : ");~N
~b~Iscanf("%f%f",&x,&y);~N   
~b~Ia=average(x,y);~N
~b~Iprintf("\n The average of %f and %f is %f",x,y,a);~N
~b~I}~N
~b~Iaverage(x,y)~N
~b~Ifloat x,y;~N
~b~I{~N  
~b~Ifloat z;~N
~b~Iz=(x+y)/2;~n
~b~Ireturn(z);~N

    ...actually, this program won't (quite) work...but let's see how to
    get it to compile and run.

   How to COMPILE   
.WN
    We save our program on disk and leave our word processor, giving 
    our program a name: ~Iprogram1.c~N ( note the necessary ~I.c~N ).

    Then we would ask the ~IC-compiler~N to compile it, with the command:

~Icc program1~N

    With this command the compiler looks for a file on the disk with the
    name ~Iprogram1.c~N ( the extension ~I.c~N being ~IUNDERSTOOD~N! ) and
    generates a file called ~Iprogram1.o~N ( an ~Io~Nbject file).

    After the compiler has done its thing it's our turn again.

    We ask to ~Ilink~N the ~Io~Nbject file by issuing the command:

~Ilink program1~N

    where, again, the extension ( ~I.o~N in this case ) is understood.

    The linker works on the ~Iprogram1.o~N file and generates an ~Iexe~Ncutable
    program called:  ~Iprogram1.exe~N

    Finally, we may issue the command: ~Iprogram1~N to run our program.
.WN





    ~INOTE~N: The  commands  necessary  to  ~Icompile~N  and  ~Ilink~N,  and the 
          eventual name of the executable program, may vary from one
          C-compiler to another. On the IBM PC, the (final, compiled)
          program will normally have the extension ~I.exe~N.
.b5-10
.W
.R12C1
    The reason for the 2-step process of ~Icompile~N then ~Ilink~N is that
    we may write (for example) the ~b~Iaverage()~N function separately, and
    ~Icompile~N it separately (generating an ~Io~Nbject file, say ~Iaverage.o~N)
    then ~Ilink~N the ~b~Imain()~N function to the ~b~Iaverage~N function by
    issuing the command: ~Ilink program1 average~N
    (where we have called the ~b~Imain()~N function ~Iprogram1.c~N when we saved
    it to disk before leaving the word processor/text editor).
.K19,30
all clear?
.WN
    Now suppose we have (successfully) compiled and linked ~Iprogram1~N.
    (our program will actually compile...without any error messages!)
    
    We have on disk ~Iprogram1.exe~N which we execute by issuing the command:
    ~Iprogram1~N  and the program will print:
                                             cursor waits for 2 numbers.
~r~I Enter two numbers (separated by a space) : ~N~IÛ~N

    ..we type:  ~I21~N ~I22~N          (leaving a space between).
    then press the Enter (or Return) key and expect to get:

~r~I The average of 21.000000 and 22.000000 is 21.500000~N

     Our program statement was:

      ~b~Iprintf("\n The average of %f and %f is %f",x,y,a);~N

      and the ~b~I%f~N gives 6 decimal places...by default ).

    Alas, what we get is:
.W
.R23C1
~r~I The average of 21.000000 and 22.000000 is 21.000000~N
.K19,60
[0;1mmamma mia!

    Let's look at the function ~b~Iaverage()~N again:

~b~Iaverage(x,y)~N
~b~Ifloat x,y;~N
~b~I{~N  
~b~Ifloat z;~N
~b~Iz=(x+y)/2;~N
~b~Ireturn(z);~N
~b~I}~N

       ~V                                                                ~N

    ...so, the value of ~b~Iz~N which ~b~Iaverage()~N returned was changed
    from 21.5 ( the ~b~Ifloat~Ning point average of the two floating point
    numbers 21 and 22 ) to 21. The fractional part was truncated since
    ( unless we ~Vsay otherwise~N ) our function returns an integer!

    And how do we tell the C-compiler that ~b~Iaverage()~N is to ~b~Ireturn~N
    a ~b~Ifloat~Ning point number?

 Since ~Icopies~N of ~b~Ichar~N and ~b~Iint~N and ~b~Ifloat~N variables are passed
 to a function, the function may manipulate these variables as it sees fit.
 The ~Ioriginal~N values remain  unchanged.  This  mechanism  for calling
 a function and passing variables is called : ~ICALL BY VALUE~N
.b1-6

 The exception occurs when we pass a ~Istring~N variable to a function. In
 this case, since a string may be arbitrarily long (!), it seems inefficient
 to provide a ~Icopy~N of the string ... so C will pass the ~Iaddress~N in memory
 where the string begins. This is called : ~ICALL BY REFERENCE~N

    ~Icall by value~N is a mixed blessing. We cannot (for example) call upon
    an ~b~Iexchange(x,y)~N function to exchange the values of the ~b~Iint~N
    variables ~b~Ix~N and ~b~Iy~N

~b~Iexchange(x,y)~N                    ~V                            ~N
~b~Iint x, y;~N                        ~V The values of x and y are  ~N
~b~I{~N                                ~V only exchanged within this ~N
~b~Iint temp;~N                        ~V function, NOT in main() !  ~N
~b~Itemp=x; x=y; y=temp; return;~N     ~V                            ~N
~b~I}~N
