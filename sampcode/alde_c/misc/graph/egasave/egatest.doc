     MSC v5.0 comes with a graphics library that is very nice, but does
     not support the saving of the EGA screen.  Because of that I have
     written a fast and not very fancy program to save and retrieve the
     EGA 640X350 16 color page 1 screen.  Please see the C code for the
     routines for details.  The routines were written for the small
     model, but they can be easily changed for the other models.  If you
     are using a model with a large data area, then the routines become
     simple because you can read and write directly to the video memory
     without any difficultly.  





     get_screen(filename);    returns integer indicating error status
     save_screen(filename);   as above

     See the C code for more details on the routines.

     To compile test program using MSC 5.0:

     cl  testega.c gtscreen.c svscreen.c



     Testega puts two colored squares on EGA 350x640 screen, saves
     screen to file and retrieves it.

     EGA screens take about 128K of disk space, so be ready.

     There is no checking of hardware, EGA with 128K assumed.
     There is no checking of EGA page, Page 1 is saved and retrieved.
     There is no packing of screen image, working on that.
