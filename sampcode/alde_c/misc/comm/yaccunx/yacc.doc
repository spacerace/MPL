        NAME:  yacc - LALR(1) Parser Generator

        SYNOPSIS:

                yacc [options] file

        DESCRIPTION:

                Yacc is the full UNIX V7 LALR(1) parser generator.  This
                version has smaller allocations for the work tables, but
                is otherwise exactly  the  UNIX  version.   For  further
                documentation  on the use and operation of yacc, see the
                UNIX documentation.  The following options are defined:

                -h              Generate "file.H" containing  the  token
                                code  #defines for your lexical analyzer
                                to #include.

                -i              Generate "file.I" containing a  descrip-
                                tion   of   the   parser   as   to   the
                                shift-reduce  actions,  and  a  set   of
                                informative statistics about parser con-

        DIAGNOSTICS:

                Usage ...

                        Illegal  options  cause  an   extensive   "help"
                        message to be printed.
