'XC' is a cross-reference printing utility for 'C' programs. It has the 
ability to handle nested include files to a depth of 8 levels and 
properly process nested comments. Important features of 'XC' are as
follows:
  							   
- Provides the capability to set the printer to compressed print mode. 
	
	The program may be customized for any printer by modifying the print
	control strings in the program.  These string are:
 
              cprint_hdr sets the printer to compressed print mode       
              cprint_trlr resets the printer to "normal" mode            

	These strings can be found in the source code with a text editor and
	modified to comform to the user's printer.

- If a form feed is detected in the source file, a new page is started.  This 
	is useful for structuring the source code by placing each major
	section on a separate page.  You do this by embedding a form feed
	(control L) in a comment.  The text following the form feed will be 
	placed on the top of the new page.  The page numbering will be
	incremented and a new header line will be placed on the	new page.                                 

-  Tab characters in the file are expanded to every 8 positions.
 
	This may be changed by changing the TABCNT define in the source code. 
        
-  The current date and time and the file latest update date and time are 
	included in the page header line.  The file date and time are 
	identical to that found in a DIR listing.

		NOTE: This feature utilizes PC-DOS 2.0 calls and will
		probably not operate correctly on DOS 1.1.  This feature
		also utilizes two CI C-86 library functions (sysint and
		segread).  If you wish to modify the program, these functions
		or their equivalent must be used.  Segread returns the
		4 segment registers, and sysint allows the user to 
		issue an interrupt and set the registers prior to the 
		interrupt as well as returns the values of the registers to
		the caller. 

-  Control characters (other than \n, \f, or \t) are stripped from the input 
	stream (converted to blanks).  This prevents extraneous control 
	characters in the input file from interfering with the operation of XC.
						 
Usage: xc <filename> <flag(s)>			   
  							   
      Flags: -i 	   = Enable file inclusion	   
  	     -l 	   = Generate listing only	   
             -c            = Compressed print listing (Prism/Microprism printer
	     -e		   = Compressed print listing (Epson printer)
  	     -r 	   = Cross-ref reserved words	   
  	     -o <filename> = Write output to named file
