     NAME
          cpg - C source listing formatter

     SYNOPSIS
          cpg [ -t tabstop ] [ file... ]

     DESCRIPTION
          CPG is a C language source listing  formatter.   It  employs
          certain  triggers  to  perform  its  formatting.  Those same
          triggers may be used to  extract  in-line  documentation  to
          create documentation.  At the end of the listing produced by
          CPG is a table  of  contents  of  all  files  and  functions
          contained  in the current listing.  The table of contents is
          sorted alphabetically by function and file.

          The listing produced by CPG includes on  each  line  a  line
          number.  On each line containing any braces ({}), there will
          also be  a  nesting  level  indicator.   The  nesting  level
          indicator  includes a number (the current nesting level) and
          a directional character.  The directional characters are:

          >     The nesting level increased on this line

          <     The nesting level decreased on this line

          *     The nesting level changed both ways, with a net change
                of zero

          The triggers that CPG recognizes are itemized  below.   Each
          must appear in column 1.

          <formfeed>
               A formfeed will cause a new page to be started  with  a
               full header.

          /*F filename *<anything>
               The file name may be specified in a comment preceding a
               descriptive  header  block.  The filename argument must
               be delimited by asterisks in the trigger.  The filename
               will  appear  in  all  page  headings  up  to  the next
               filename trigger or the next file.  A filename  comment
               block must be terminated by the endofblock trigger (see
               below).  This trigger will  print  as  a  line  in  the
               listing.   This  trigger causes the start of a new page
               (form feed) in the listing, with printing of  the  page
               header including the current file name.

          /*H funcname *<anything>
               The  function  name  may  be  specified  in  a  comment
               preceding  a  descriptive  header  block.  The funcname
               argument must be delimited by asterisks in the trigger.
               The funcname will appear in all page headings up to the

     cpg(1)              UNIX 5.0 (Benetics Local)              cpg(1)



               next funcname trigger or the  next  file.   A  funcname
               comment  block  must  be  terminated  by the endofblock
               trigger (see below).  This trigger will print as a line
               in the listing.  This trigger causes the start of a new
               page (form feed) in the listing, with printing  of  the
               page header including the current function name.

          /*E*/
               This is the endofblock trigger.  Everything between the
               last  filename  or  funcname trigger and the endofblock
               trigger will be passed straight through by CPG  without
               evaluation  of  nesting  levels,  comments,  or  quoted
               strings.  Thus, a header block is treated as  one  long
               comment  by  CPG.  This trigger will print as a line in
               the listing.

          /*P*/
               This is a page eject trigger.  It will not print in the
               listing,   but  will  be  counted  for  line  numbering
               purposes.  This trigger causes the page heading, title,
               and  subtitle  to  be  reprinted based on their current
               values (see title and subtitle below).

          /*S <text> */
               This  is  the  subtitle  trigger.   It  determines  the
               contents  of  the second title line on the page header.
               All characters after the initial space and  up  to  but
               not  including  the  following  asterisk (required) are
               included as part of the subtitle.   This  trigger  will
               not  print  in the listing but will be counted for line
               numbering purposes.

          /*T <text> */
               This is the title trigger.  It determines the  contents
               of  the  first  title  line  on  the  page header.  All
               characters after the initial space and up  to  but  not
               including   the   following   asterisk  (required)  are
               included as part of the title.  This trigger  will  not
               print  in  the  listing  but  will  be counted for line
               numbering purposes.

        Options
          -t tabstop  The tabstop argument to the -t option  specifies
                      how  to expand tabs.  The expansion is performed
                      automatically with a tabstop of  8  if  none  is
                      specified.

        Arguments
          file        Any number of file names may be specified on the
                      command  line  (within  limits  set by whichever
                      shell is used).  Each file will be formatted and
                      its  name added to the table of contents.  If no

     FILES

                              contents.

     NOTES
          This tool was developed at Benetics Corporation.

          A side note: CPG also properly processes comments  in  shell
          scripts and makefiles.  These comments are correctly handled
          when the comment character (# or :) is  the  first  nonblank
          character  on  a line.  In order to facilitate documentation
          of shell scripts, CPG recognizes the sequences #{ and #}  as
          the  beginning  and ending of nesting, and treats them as it
          does in C program sources.  Thus lengthy for, if, while, and
          case statements may be more clearly documented as to nesting
          levels, particulary in shell scripts.
