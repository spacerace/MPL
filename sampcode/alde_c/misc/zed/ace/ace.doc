     Loading ACE...

     You can load ACE four different ways:
     1. Type "ace" on the A> prompt.  This will load the editor and then ask for
        the file you wish to edit.

     2. Type "ace" followed by a space and the name of the file you wish to load,
        e.g.  A>ace example.c.  This example would load the editor, then load the
        file "example.c" into its buffer.

     3. Type "ace/l" which will load the last file you edited automatically
        without displaying the logo.

     4. When you become a registered user, you will be able to bypass the logo.

     Using ACE...

                                   MOVING THE CURSOR

     To move the cursor up, down, left, and right use the arrow keys.  To move the
  cursor one word to the left hit the Ctrl key then the left arrow key.  To move
  the cursor one word at a time to the right press the Ctrl key then the right
  arrow key.














ACE  Ver 1.24                                                         - Page 2 -


     To go to the beginning of a line press the Home key.  To go to the end of a
  line press the End key.  To go to the top of the window press the Ctrl key then
  the Home key.  To get to the bottom of the window press the Ctrl key then the
  End key.  To scroll a page up towards the beginning of the file press the PgUp
  key.  To scroll a page down towards the end of the file press the PgDn key.  To
  go to the beginning of the file press the Ctrl key then PgUp key.  To go to the
  end of the file press the Ctrl key then the PgDn key.

     When you look at the left side of the screen, you will see a marker.  This
  marker shows you where you are in your document relative to the beginning and
  end of the current file.  If the marker is in the middle of the screen, you are
  around the middle of the document.

     Press the Scroll Lock key and "SCRL" will appear at the top of the screen,
  indicating that you are in a special mode.  When in this mode, some of the keys'
  meanings change.  The Home key now will move the cursor to the left side of the
  screen (as opposed to the start of a line).  The End key will go move it to the
  right side of the screen.  The up arrow will scroll up a half screen.  The down
  arrow will scroll down half a screen.  The left arrow will scroll left 4 times
  the tab size.  The right arrow will scroll right 4 times the tab size.

     Also, you may move the cursor beyond the end of a line.  When you are beyond
  the end of a line, as soon as you press a character key ACE will automatically
  pad spaces from the end of the line to the cursor. It then inserts the
  character.  This padding also works for block moves, copies, etc.  When you are
  beyond the end of the line the destructive backspace acts just like the left
  arrow, and the delete key is disabled.

                                    INSERTING TEXT

     Whenever the cursor is a large block, you are in insert mode.  If it is
  small, you are in overtype mode.  When you are in insert mode, each time you
  press a key all the text from the cursor on is moved over a character and the
  key you pressed is inserted in the new space.  When you are in overtype mode,
  the character you press replaces whatever is under the cursor.  If you want to
  toggle the insert and overtype modes, you just press the Ins key.

                                     DELETING TEXT

     If you want to delete text you can use the backspace key, the delete key,
  block delete, or a line delete.  The backspace key when in insert mode, takes
  all the text from the cursor on and moves it one character to the left,
  replacing the character to the left of the cursor.  The Del key takes the text
  next to the cursor and moves it over so that it replaces the character beneath
  the cursor.

     Before you can do a block delete you must DEFINE A BLOCK.  To do this place
  the cursor at the beginning or ending of the text you want to define as a block.
  Press the F6 key.  This starts the definition of a block, now move the cursor
  you will see the text highlighted as you move along.  When you finish marking
  off the text you want defined as a block press the F6 key again.  This stops the
  definition.  Now if you want to delete the block press Alt and D for delete and
  the block will be deleted.  Other uses for the blocks are explained below.










ACE  Ver 1.24                                                         - Page 3 -


     To automatically delete a line without having to define it as a block just
  press Alt and the E key for erase.  This will delete the line that the cursor is
  on.

                                     USING BLOCKS

     Block operations are powerful; they allow you to easily make large changes
  which would otherwise be tedious and time consuming.  An example is Copy Block.
  To do this, define a block (see above), then just press the Alt key then the C
  key (for "copy") and a copy of the block will be inserted at the cursor
  position.  You can also move a block, which means delete it then place it at the
  cursor position.  To do this press the Alt key then the M key.  ACE makes
  changing whole chunks of code easier by combining deleting and changing into one
  operation.  You can press the Alt key and the L key to delete the line the
  cursor is on and replace it with the block.  Press the Alt key and the B key to
  delete everything within the nearest braces { } and insert a copy of the block.

     After you define a block and the highlight bothers you, you may press the Alt
  key then the F6 key to undefine the block.

  NOTE:
  You may not you use the Alt C, M, L, or B commands while the cursor is in the
  block.  But you may use the Alt D command while the cursor is in the block.

                            MISCELLANEOUS EDITING FEATURES

     Sometimes you may need to place SPECIAL CHARACTERS in the text that ACE
  normally will not let you use (ASCII codes 216-255).  To do this press the Alt
  Key then the X key.  ACE will then prompt you at the top of the screen.  Type in
  the code you would like to insert or overtype (depending on the mode you're in)
  and press the return key.  That character will then be placed in the text.
  (Note: you may not insert code 254*!).

     ACE contains special functions to help you in writing programs, C programs in
  particular.  One of these is the Alt R command; this places at the cursor a */
  then scans the line and figures out what kind of line it is (code, comment, or
  code with a comment at the end).  It then places at the appropriate place a /*.
  It will also if you have defined a block and the cursor is within the block,
  place remarks around the block.  This is helpful when you want the compiler to
  ignore a whole section of code.

     In the options menu, there is an option called "automatic indent".  This
  feature when active, will automatically, when you press enter, space the
  inserted line over so that it starts below the first non-space character in the
  line above.



  ____________________

  * - When you load or are editing a file, all ASCII character 174's are displayed
      as 254's.  When you save the file all the 254's are converted back to 174's.
      So even though an ASCII code 254 may be on the screen, it actually in the
      end will be a 174.









ACE  Ver 1.24                                                         - Page 4 -


     There is also an option called "indent after {".  This feature when active,
  will automatically, when you press enter, scan the line for a {.  If it finds
  one it will insert a tab in the new line.

     The option called "Automatic remarks" when active will after you press enter,
  scan the line and determine if it is a line of code.  If it is it will insert a
  /* and place the cursor after it.  At this point you may type in a remark, or
  you may press enter, which erase the /* and goes to the next line.  If you typed
  in a remark and you are finished, press enter and ACE will insert a */ and go on
  to the next line.  This feature is great for commenting your program for others
  to see.

                                USER DEFINABLE WINDOWS

     When programming, there always seem to be things which you need periodically
  but not often enough to commit to memory.  Wouldn't it be handy if, instead of
  getting out K&R or some other book or document, and looking up something in the
  index, finding the correct page, etc., you could create help windows, callable
  from inside your editor?

     Ace gives you this capability by allowing you to open a window in the top
  half of the screen into which you can load any maximum 3K file.  You may only
  scroll through this file; you may not edit it.  To open this window press the
  Alt key then F2 this will give you a choice between opening or closing the
  window.  Select Open, then type in the name of the file to load.  If you want to
  close it just select Close.  When you are in the help window the you can use the
  normal scroll keys to scroll.  When you want to switch between windows, press
  Alt F1.  You can tell which window you're in by where the ACE sign is.

     Some sample help files (with the extension ".hlp") have been included.  Of
  course, help files are only one possible use for the window; any type of file
  may be loaded into it.

     If you wish you may change the size of the help window once it is loaded.
  For information read about the Utilities menu.

                                    USING THE MENUS

     To access the main menu press the Esc key.  You will be shown a list of
  options.  To select one, just press the capitalized letter you see in that
  option.  The main menu options are:

     Files - This takes you to the Files submenu which is:
       * Load   - Allows you to load a file.
       * Save   - Allows you to save the current file with the same name or with a
                  different name.  To save it with the same name just press enter
                  when it asks you for the filename, otherwise type in the name of
                  the file and press return.
       * Rename - Allows you to change the name of a file on disk.  If you want
                  the name of the file you are working on to be changed just press
                  enter for the old filename prompt then type in the new name for
                  the new name prompt and it will be changed.
       * Erase  - This allows you to delete the file you specify from the disk.

       * Block  - This takes you to the Block submenu which looks like this:
          - Load   - Allows you to load a file which is then marked as a block and
                     placed at the end of the current file.
          - Save   - Allows you to take a block you have defined and save it to a
                     file.
       * Print  - Allows you to print the file or block out on a printer with or
                  without line numbers.  It will print out the block if the cursor
                  is within the block otherwise it will print the entire file.
       * sTatus - Shows you the file you are working on and the length of it in
                  bytes.
       * Quit   - Allows you to quit the editor.
       * Dos    - Allows you to exit to dos and run another program or execute dos
                  commands while keeping ACE in memory.  Type EXIT at the dos
                  prompt to return to ACE.  (You must be using dos 2.0 or higher
                  to use this function.)
     Search     - Takes you to a sub-menu where you instruct ACE to search for a
                  string.
     Replace    - Sub-menu to search for a string and replace it with another
                  string.
     Goto       - Allows you to go to a line number or to a tagged position.
     Tag        - Allows you to tag a line so that you can later go to it without
                  having to remember line numbers.
     Version    - Shows the name of the user and serial number.
     Attributes - Allows you to change the attributes of the editor, color, block
                  color, border color, etc.
     Options    - Allows you to change the tab size, column starting position,
                  automatic indentation, indent after left brace, automatic
                  remarks and the drive that ACE goes to for DOS.
     Utilities  - Takes you the Utilities sub-menu where you can have ACE convert
                  all the tab characters (ASCII 9's) to spaces, where you can
                  change the size of the help window, or where you can have ACE
                  scan your program for errors, nested comments, missing braces,
                  etc.

                                     USING SEARCH

     When you select the search command your screen should look like this:

  Search string:
  DIRECTION: Up  Down  CASE: Yes  No

     Some of the options should also be inside parentheses, meaning they are
  selected.  The direction field is just the direction the search goes from the
  cursor.  The case field specifies whether a string found in the text has to
  match the search string exactly or if they can be somewhat different, for
  example.  If you searched for Int with case set to yes, it would only find Int
  not int.  If the case was set to no, it could find Int, int, iNt, INT, inT, etc.
  Also you may place a question mark in the search field to represent any
  character.  If you were to search for i?t it could find int, ibt, ict, izt, etc.

     To set a field, press ALT 1 before you type in any search text.  Now press
  the capitalized letter(s) of the options you wish to select, and then press the
  Esc key to resume typing the search text.










ACE  Ver 1.24                                                         - Page 6 -


                                     USING REPLACE

     When you select the replace command your screen should look like this:

  Search string:
  DIRECTION: Up Down  CASE: Yes  No  CONVERT TO: uPper  Lower  nEither
  CONFIRM: yeS  nO

     The direction and case fields are the same as in search, but Convert and
  Confirm are different.  Convert is used to change the case of letters.  If you
  place a question mark in the replace text, then when ACE finds match, it will
  convert the character in the same position of the question mark to upper case,
  lower case, or not convert at all.  If you were to search for ? and replace with
  ? and have convert set to upper case it would convert all the characters it
  found to upper case.  If you have selected Confirm, ACE will ask you in each
  instance whether or not to perform the replace before actually doing it.

                                CHANGING THE ATTRIBUTES

     The attributes window can be opened by selecting Attributes from the main
  menu, or by pressing the F5 key.  After loading in the data file it should look
  something like this:

     Shown are the default values for ACE.  The top five options are displayed in
  their perspective colors; these options let you set the colors that you see on
  your screen.  The next three options are characters that ACE will display on
  different parts of the screen.

     To change an option, just press the number of that option.  If it is a color
  option it will ask you for the foreground color number (0-15), then the
  background color number (0-7), then if you want it to blink.  If it is a
  character option, ACE will ask you for the new character.  To enter the
  character just press the key, or press the Alt key, then the number of the
  character on the keypad.  The character can be any value from 0 through 255.

     The first option, text color, defines what normal text looks like.  The
  second option, block color, defines what color blocks will be.  The third, end
  of file color, defines what color the end of file mark will be.  The fourth,
  carriage return color, defines what color the end of line mark will be. The
  fifth option, border color, defines what color the border will be.

     The character attributes can be any one character.  The carriage return
  character is what appears at the end of every line.  The thumb character is the
  character ACE uses at the side of the window to represent your position in the
  document.  The end of file character is the character that you see at the end of
  the document.

     When you finish typing in all the new values and press enter, they are all
  automatically saved in a data file that will be loaded whenever you enter ACE.

                         Shown are the default values for ACE.

     In this menu you go through the options all at once, one at a time.  To
  change a fields value just type in the new value and the cursor will
  automatically go to the next field.

     The first option, tab size, defines how large your tabs will be, if you enter
  a 0 for tab size the tab key will insert ASCII 9's instead of spaces.  The
  second option, column start position, defines what line and row number ACE
  displays at the top of the file, either a 1 or a 0.  The third option allows you
  to specify whether automatic indentation will take place after you press enter
  at the end of each line.  The fourth option allows you to specify if the line is
  tabbed over an extra tab if a left brace is found in the line when enter is
  pressed.  The fifth option specifies whether ACE will automatically remark your
  program.  The sixth option specifies where ACE will look for command.com when
  you execute the DOS command.
























ACE  Ver 1.24                                                         - Page 8 -


                                THE UTILITIES SUB-MENU

     The utilities menu can be opened by selecting utilities from the main window.
  The utilities sub-menu should look like this:

  Convert all tabs to spaces    Window resize    Scan for errors

     If you select the convert function all the tabs (ASCII 9's) in the file or
  block (depending where the cursor is) will be expanded to its appropriate number
  of spaces.

     The window resize allows you to change the size of the help window to make it
  larger or smaller.  (you can only do this when the help file is opened)

     The scan for errors allows you to check your program for minor errors, like
  nested comments, to many left or right braces, missing quotes, or missing single
  quotes.  It would be wise to run this function before you compile your program,
  for it could save you a lot of time in the end.

                            WHAT THE CONTRIBUTION GETS YOU

     When you make a contribution of $35 or more you will become a registered
  user, receive  the latest  version,  the  latest documentation, and notices of
  new software and revisions from C-STUFF that can be sent to you upon request.
  (Make sure to send your name, address, and phone number.)

     You may for $10 have me rewrite ACE for your particular language  (please
  include details about your language, such as what remarks are delimited by, what
  functions are delimited by, etc).  Right now doing this would change the Alt R,
  and the Alt B functions.  If you think this isn't worth the 10 dollars wait
  until an upcoming version!  It will have many, awesome, excellent and fantastic
  features to help you with your programming.  It's your choice though, to wait,
  or do it now.  It's only 10 dollars!

     If you have any ideas or have found some bugs, please call or write me.  If I
  like your idea or you have found a true bug, I will send you the latest public
  version.  You may only get the LATEST version if you are a registered user, for
  I will only upload a new version to bulletin boards once every 6 months, and
  after a version has been time tested, NEVER.  So register now, and be supported.

     Note:  When you wish to have an update, send your name, address, serial
  number and $10 to cover for the disk and mailing.  You may only send ACE in for
  rewriting if you are a registered user.

                                       NOTE:
  This version (1.24) of ACE, depending on how much memory you have, has a maximum
  buffer of 62K with a maximum of 3000 lines.  The more memory you have the larger
  the buffer is.  You can find out how large a buffer you have, by going to the
  files menu and selecting sTatus.  It will show you the length of your file, and
  the space left.  Make sure you do not go past the buffer length, if you do the
  results could be fatal.  This will be prevented in later versions.
