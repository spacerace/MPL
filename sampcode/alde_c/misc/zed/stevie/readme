STEVIE Source Release

This is a source release of the STEVIE editor, a public domain clone
of the UNIX editor 'vi'. The program was originally developed for the
Atari ST, but has been ported to UNIX and OS/2 as well.

To compile STEVIE, you'll also need Henry Spencer's regular expression
library.

To compile STEVIE for one of the provided systems:

Good Luck...
