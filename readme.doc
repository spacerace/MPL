OS/2 CD-ROM SUPPORT
===================
Microsoft Corporation has developed an installable file system for
OS/2 (version 1.2), which is compatible with CD-ROM drives.  The
operation of a CD-ROM drive also requires a device driver compatible
with the device controller of your specific model, as well as your
specific drive.  For availability of both components, please contact
your CD-ROM drive manufacturer.

DO NOT PASTE WHEN "UNKNOWN" IS DISPLAYED
========================================
Programmer's Library can be run as a memory-resident T.S.R., which
will pop-up for easy reference while you are in a text editor.  In
many cases, you can also PASTE selected material from Programmer's
Library into your editor.

If Programmer's Library is popped up over some text-editors, Pro-
grammer's Library may enter "Unknown" mode (the word "Unknown" appears
on the Programmer's Library title bar, above the Main menu bar).

In "Unknown" mode, paste and date stamp are enabled; however, WE
STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU REFRAIN FROM PASTING WHENEVER "Unknown"
IS DISPLAYED.  This condition can easily lead to a system crash.

In such cases, you can still collect material in the Programmer's
Library clipboard.  Use the SAVE CLIPBOARD command (in the OPTIONS
menu) to export the clipboard contents to an ASCII file, which can
be easily imported by your program editor.  This practice also
provides the advantage of being able to store various content in
separate files, for easier inclusion in different parts of the
program you are currently editing.


PASTING IN MICROSOFT EDITORS FROM THE T.S.R.
============================================
The following shows which Microsoft language editing environments
support direct paste from Programmer's Library in T.S.R. mode:

Supported
---------
  Microsoft-C Professional Development System (v6.0) using Programmer's
     Work Bench.
  Microsoft QuickC version 2.0
  BASIC Professional Development System (v7.1) using PROGRAMMER's WORK
     BENCH.  (Versions 7.0 and 7.1 using the QBX editor do not support
     TSR-mode PASTE).
  QuickBASIC version 4.5
  QuickPASCAL version 1.0
  Microsoft "M" Editor


Known to Cause Problems (Does not support direct PASTE)
-----------------------
  Microsoft QuickC version 2.5
  BASIC Professional Development System, v7.0 and v7.1 using QBX



GENERAL NOTES
=============

Text Editors Only!
------------------
Although you can use Microsoft Programmer's Library with almost any type
of software, it is designed so that you can copy and paste into text
editor and word-processor software ONLY.  If you try to copy and paste
sample code or text into other types of software (for example, CAD pro-
grams, software tutorials) that expect specific keystroke responses, you
will likely experience problems.


MS-DOS 4.x
----------
If you intend to use Microsoft Library products with MS-DOS 4.x, you must
use the MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions version 2.1 (or higher).  To upgrade your
version of the MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions:
	- Contact the manufacturer of your CD-ROM drive
	- Call Meridian Data at (408) 476-5858.


Sample Code
-----------
Programmer's Library sample code is contained in ASCII text files in the 
\SAMPCODE directory on the Programmer's Library CD-ROM disc.  You can use 
your editor to copy and paste any of these directly into your program's 
source code independent of Programmer's Library.  Sample program subdir-
ectories are explained in the CONTENTS.DOC file in the CD-ROM's root
directory.   Sample code is provided for your convenience and education;
but is not warrantied by Microsoft.


Stand-alone operation
---------------------
You can use Programmer's Library as a stand-alone program and still
incorporate its text and sample code into your own programs.  To do so,
copy the data you need into the Programmer's Library Clipboard (appending
as necessary), and save the Clipboard data as an ASCII text file.  Later,
you can call the ASCII text file you saved into your text editor.


TSR operation
-------------
If you use Programmer's Library as a memory-resident program, load it
into memory before loading your text editor or any other application and
unload it only after exiting any other programs that were subsequently
started.

Programmer's Library may behave erratically if it is popped up after
another memory-resident program that was also popped up over your text
editor.  For best results, pop up only one memory-resident program at a
time.

Load keyboard enhancement programs BEFORE loading Programmer's Library.
Load other memory-resident programs AFTER Programmer's Library.

We recommend that you edit your CONFIG.SYS file so that it assigns values
of at least:
         files = 15
         buffers = 20


Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions
---------------------------
For the most efficient interaction between Programmer's Libarary and the
MS CD-ROM Extensions, set the MSCDEX /M: buffers option to 10 (at a
minimum) or 12 (for best effect).  The following is a sample command line
that starts the Extensions with buffers set to 12:
	C:\> MSCDEX /D:MSCD001 /M:12




SPECIFIC TEXT EDITOR AND WORD PROCESSOR NOTES
=============================================

Brief
-----
When Brief starts up, the default line length is 144 characters.  If the
cursor is at the beginning of an 80-character line and if another 80-
character line is pasted into Brief from Programmer's Library, then the
last 16 characters to be pasted will be lost.  We recommend that when
you start Brief you use the -lxxx switch to alter its default line
length.  An example command-line call is: b -p -c1,1,3,3 -l160 <Enter>

Be sure to start Brief with the "-p" command line switch (as shown above).
Doing so ensures that Programmer's Library and Brief do not try to write
to the same video page at the same time.


Microsoft QuickC
----------------
-Version 2.5:
 Programmer's Library can be run as a T.S.R. over QuickC 2.5; but does
 not support direct paste operations.  Instead, select the text you wish
 to save, COPY or APPEND to the Programmer's Library clipboard; and
 use the Save Clipboard command (OPTIONS menu) to store the clipboard
 contents in an ASCII file.  Return to QuickC and use the FILE OPEN
 to include the ASCII file contents in your edit environment.

-Version 2.0:
 Turn on insert mode before pasting sample code into your program.

 If you use the /h option with QC and are running Programmer's Library
 in TSR mode, run the 43.COM program in the CD-ROM's \MSLIB directory
 before starting QC.


Microsoft QuickBASIC and Microsoft QuickPASCAL
----------------------------------------------
Turn off syntax checking AND turn on insert mode before pasting sample
code into your program.  To pop up Programmer's Library, press the
shift key and THEN the Alt key.

If you use the /h option with QB and are running Programmer's Library
in TSR mode, run the 43.COM program in the CD-ROM's \MSLIB directory
before starting QB.


Microsoft Programmer's Workbench, 'M' Editors
---------------------------------------------
Turn on insert mode before pasting contents into your program.


Microsoft BASIC: QBX Editor
---------------------------
Programmer's Library can be run as a T.S.R. over QBX; but does
not support direct paste operations.  Instead, select the text you wish
to save, COPY or APPEND to the Programmer's Library clipboard; and
use the Save Clipboard command (OPTIONS menu) to store the clipboard
contents in an ASCII file.  Return to QBX and use the FILE LOAD
to include the ASCII file contents in your edit environment.


Microsoft Word
--------------
Versions 2.0 and 3.0
  --Graphics mode not supported.  A beep sounds if you attempt to pop up
    Programmer's Library over graphics mode.
Versions 3.1, 3.2, and 4.0
  --Programmer's Library will temporarily turn off graphics mode while it
    is popped up.  Graphics mode will be turned on again when it is popped
    down.
Version 5.0
  --Graphics mode not supported.  Before popping up Programmer's Library
    over graphics mode, use the Alt-F9 key or the Options command to
    switch to text mode.  The Alt-F9 key will return you to your previous
    mode when Programmer's Library is popped down.
  --When setting up Word 5.0, you must choose the "safe keyboard support"
    option.


Microsoft Works
---------------
When pasting whole paragraphs into the header/footer, you must delete hard
carriage returns (<Enter>) and insert soft carriage returns (<Shift>-
<Enter>) in their place.


WordPerfect
-----------
Version 4.2
--Pasting lines that extend into the "hot zone" can cause WordPerfect to
  prompt you for hyphen placement, and can cause the rest of the "to-be-
  pasted" text to be "lost."  To avoid this situation, set your margins or
  columns at least 80 characters apart.
Version 5.0
--Programmer's Library will not pop up when you are in Print Preview mode.

--If you redefine your default BLOCK mode toggle key default <Alt>-<F4>,
  Programmer's Library will not know that BLOCK mode has been toggled, and
  WordPerfect will ignore your paste.


XyWrite III
-----------
Follow the instructions that accompany the XyWrite documentation for
setting up XyWrite to run with memory-resident programs.  If you don't,
you will likely experience serious problems.

You must use the default command prompt "CM" in order for Programmer's
Library to "know" that it is to work with XyWrite III. For this reason,
we recommend that you don't reconfigure the XyWrite III command prompt.

Don't pop up Programmer's Library over XyWrite III help screens.


Wordstar Professional Releases 4.0 & 5.0
----------------------------------------
Turn off Wordstar's special character-formatting symbols (^b, for bold,
for example) before Programmer's Library is popped up.

Paste from Programmer's Library only when Wordstar is in insert mode.

You must be using help levels 1, 2, or 3 for Programmer's Library to
"know" that it is working with Wordstar.


DisplayWrite 3 version 1.10 and DisplayWrite 4 version 1.0
----------------------------------------------------------
Supported by Programmer's Library in their default configurations



VIDEO DISPLAY NOTES
===================
To correctly use a Hercules graphics adapter with Microsoft Word and
Programmer's Library, the environment variable HERCGB102 must be set
to TRUE.  Place the following entry in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
           SET HERCGB102 = TRUE 

If you have a Hercules graphics adapter and you use Microsoft Word, you
must use Word in character mode (all versions) if you intend to use
Programmer's Library.

If you are using a monochrome monitor driven by a graphics video card, or
a gas plasma display, start Programmer's Library using the /b command line
switch.

Programmer's Library uses the current video page to display data.
Occasionally, less well-behaved software will not inform the bios of what
video page it is using.  This may cause a conflict with Programmer's
Library, and Programmer's Library may appear not to be working.  If this
is true with your software, please check the manual for instruction on how
to make the first video page (page 0) the default.

If you have any difficulty using Programmer's Library in 43- or 50-line
video modes, run the 43.COM program in the CD-ROM's \MSLIB directory be-
fore popping up Programmer's Library.


USING PROGRAMMER'S LIBRARY WITH A MOUSE
=======================================

Occasionally, your text editor's mouse cursor will be "frozen" on your
screen when you call up Programmer's Library.  In that case, you will see
another mouse cursor, which Programmer's Library controls, and which will
work properly.  When you pop out of Programmer's Library, your text editor's
mouse cursor will be "unfrozen," and the Programmer's Library mouse cursor
will disappear.


Microsoft
---------
If you use a Microsoft Mouse, we recommend that you upgrade your Microsoft
Mouse driver IF it is a version earlier than 6.25.  If you upgrade and if
you use the MOUSE.SYS driver, delete your earlier version of MOUSE.SYS and
replace it with the MOUSE.SYS driver that resides on the Programmer's
Library CD-ROM disc.  Likewise, if you use MOUSE.COM, delete your earlier
version and replace it with the MOUSE.COM that resides on the Programmer's
Library CD-ROM disc.

Note: The 6.25 driver on the CD-ROM is NOT the latest mouse software
version.  The latest software is available from your computer software
supplier.


Mouse Systems
-------------
If you use the Mouse Systems PC Mouse and have problems with mouse behavior
in Programmer's Library, be sure you are using an MSMOUSE driver version
later than 4.70.  We recommend that you always use the latest mouse driver
software.  Check with your mouse manufacturer about getting an update.

USING PROGRAMMER'S LIBRARY WITH MULTIPLE CD-ROM DRIVES
======================================================
Programmer's Library setup creates a file called MSL.INI.  This file
contains paths for each Microsoft Library product.  The paths assume that
each product is in the same logical disk drive as it was when you first
ran setup.

If you change the drive in which Microsoft Library products are found,
you must also change the appropriate path names in MSL.INI.


MANUAL SETUP PROCEDURES
=======================
If you encounter problems with the setup program or if you simply prefer
to set up manually, follow the procedures below, which assume the
following about your system configuration:
        Hard Drive is drive C:
        CD-ROM Drive is drive D:

  1. On your hard drive, create a subdirectory called "MSLIB".
                C:\>md MSLIB <Enter>

  2. Change to the MSLIB subdirectory by typing "cd MSLIB" and ENTER.
                C:\>cd MSLIB <Enter>

  3. Place the Programmer's Library CD-ROM disc in your D: drive.

  4. Copy all files in the MSLIB directory on drive D: (your CD-ROM
     drive) to the MSLIB directory on drive C.
                C:\MSLIB>copy d:\MSLIB\*.* <Enter>

  5. With your text editor, create an ASCII text file named MSL.INI, which
     should look like this:

[msl]
        os2,     OS/2 References,     D:\BOOKS, 2011
        windows, Windows References,  D:\BOOKS, 2012
        net,     Network References,  D:\BOOKS, 2013
        msdos,   MS-DOS References,   D:\BOOKS, 2014
        msj,     MS Systems Journal,  D:\BOOKS, 4015
        hw,      Hardware References, D:\BOOKS, 4016
        c,       C References,        D:\BOOKS, 2017
        masm,    MASM References,     D:\BOOKS, 2018
        basic,   BASIC References,    D:\BOOKS, 2019
        pascal,  Pascal References,   D:\BOOKS, 2020
        fortran, FORTRAN References,  D:\BOOKS, 2021

  6. From the MSLIB directory on drive C:, type "MSL" to load Programmer's 
     Library and to run it as a standalone application.
                C:\MSLIB>msl <Enter>

     To load Programmer's Library and run it as a memory-resident program,
     type:
             C:\MSLIB>msl -t <Enter>


  See Appendix A in the User's Manual for more information on the individual
  fields and format of the MSL.INI file.


ERROR MESSAGES

"RE-RUN SETUP" 
--------------
When a file necessary to Programmer's Library operation is corrupted or
deleted, an error message prompts you to rerun setup.  First, delete the
file "MSL.VER", and then rerun setup for the product that was being used
when the error message was produced.  If you are using more than one
CD-ROM disc (for example, Programmer's Library, Small Business Consultant, and
Stat Pack) and you encounter another "rerun setup" error message, then
repeat the procedure for the disc that you were using when you encountered
the message.
